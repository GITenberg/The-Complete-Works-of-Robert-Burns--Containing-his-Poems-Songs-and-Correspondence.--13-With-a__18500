<p>[On the title-page of the second or Edinburgh edition, were these
words: &#8220;Poems, chiefly in the Scottish Dialect, by Robert Burns,
printed for the Author, and sold by William Creech, 1787.&#8221; The motto
of the Kilmarnock edition was omitted; a very numerous list of
subscribers followed: the volume was printed by the celebrated
Smellie.]</p>


<p><span class="smcap">My Lords and Gentlemen</span>:</p>

<p>A Scottish Bard, proud of the name, and whose highest ambition is to
sing in his country&#8217;s service, where shall he so properly look for
patronage as to the illustrious names of his native land: those who
bear the honours and inherit the virtues of their ancestors? The
poetic genius of my country found me, as the prophetic bard Elijah did
Elisha&mdash;at the <span class="smcap">plough</span>, and threw her inspiring mantle over
me. She bade me sing the loves, the joys, the rural scenes and rural
pleasures of my native soil, in my native tongue; I tuned my wild,
artless notes as she inspired. She whispered me to come to this
ancient metropolis of Caledonia, and lay my songs under your honoured
protection: I now obey her dictates.</p>

<p>Though much indebted to your goodness, I do not approach you, my Lords
and Gentlemen, in the usual style of dedication, to thank you for past
favours: that path is so hackneyed by prostituted learning that honest
rusticity is ashamed of it. Nor do I present this address with the
venal soul of a servile author, looking for a continuation of those
favours: I was bred to the plough, and am independent. I come to claim
the common Scottish name with you, my illustrious countrymen; and to
tell the world that I glory in the title. I come to congratulate my
country that the blood of her ancient heroes still runs
uncontaminated, and that from your courage, knowledge, and public<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
spirit, she may expect protection, wealth, and liberty. In the last
place, I come to proffer my warmest wishes to the great fountain of
honour, the Monarch of the universe, for your welfare and happiness.</p>

<p>When you go forth to waken the echoes, in the ancient and favourite
amusement of your forefathers, may Pleasure ever be of your party: and
may social joy await your return! When harassed in courts or camps
with the jostlings of bad men and bad measures, may the honest
consciousness of injured worth attend your return to your native
seats; and may domestic happiness, with a smiling welcome, meet you at
your gates! May corruption shrink at your kindling indignant glance;
and may tyranny in the ruler, and licentiousness in the people,
equally find you an inexorable foe!</p>

<p class="sig1">I have the honour to be,</p>

<p class="sig2">With the sincerest gratitude and highest respect,</p>

<p class="sig3">My Lords and Gentlemen,</p>

<p class="sig4">Your most devoted humble servant,</p>

<p class="sig5">ROBERT BURNS.</p>

<h2>PREFACE.</h2>


<p>I cannot give to my country this edition of one of its favourite
poets, without stating that I have deliberately omitted several pieces
of verse ascribed to Burns by other editors, who too hastily, and I
think on insufficient testimony, admitted them among his works. If I
am unable to share in the hesitation expressed by one of them on the
authorship of the stanzas on &#8220;Pastoral Poetry,&#8221; I can as little share
in the feelings with which they have intruded into the charmed circle
of his poetry such compositions as &#8220;Lines on the Ruins of Lincluden
College,&#8221; &#8220;Verses on the Destruction of the Woods of Drumlanrig,&#8221;
&#8220;Verses written on a Marble Slab in the Woods of Aberfeldy,&#8221; and those
entitled &#8220;The Tree of Liberty.&#8221; These productions, with the exception
of the last, were never seen by any one even in the handwriting of
Burns, and are one and all wanting in that original vigour of language
and manliness of sentiment which distinguish his poetry. With respect
to &#8220;The Tree of Liberty&#8221; in particular, a subject dear to the heart of
the Bard, can any one conversant with his genius imagine that he
welcomed its growth or celebrated its fruit with such &#8220;capon craws&#8221; as
these?</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;Upo&#8217; this tree there grows sic fruit,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Its virtues a&#8217; can tell, man;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It raises man aboon the brute,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">It mak&#8217;s him ken himsel&#8217;, man.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gif ance the peasant taste a bit,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He&#8217;s greater than a lord, man,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An&#8217; wi&#8217; a beggar shares a mite<br /></span>
<span class="i2">O&#8217; a&#8217; he can afford, man.&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>There are eleven stanzas, of which the best, compared with the &#8220;A
man&#8217;s a man for a&#8217; that&#8221; of Burns, sounds like a cracked pipkin
against the &#8220;heroic clang&#8221; of a Damascus blade. That it is extant in
the handwriting of the poet cannot be taken as a proof that it is his
own composition, against the internal testimony of utter want of all
the marks by which we know him&mdash;the Burns-stamp, so to speak, which is
visible on all that ever came from his pen. Misled by his handwriting,
I inserted in my former edition of his works an epitaph, beginning</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;Here lies a rose, a budding rose,&#8221;<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span></div></div>

<p>the composition of Shenstone, and which is to be found in the
church-yard of Hales-Owen: as it is not included in every edition of
that poet&#8217;s acknowledged works, Burns, who was an admirer of his
genius, had, it seems, copied it with his own hand, and hence my
error. If I hesitated about the exclusion of &#8220;The Tree of Liberty,&#8221;
and its three false brethren, I could have no scruples regarding the
fine song of &#8220;Evan Banks,&#8221; claimed and justly for Miss Williams by Sir
Walter Scott, or the humorous song called &#8220;Shelah O&#8217;Neal,&#8221; composed by
the late Sir Alexander Boswell. When I have stated that I have
arranged the Poems, the Songs, and the Letters of Burns, as nearly as
possible in the order in which they were written; that I have omitted
no piece of either verse or prose which bore the impress of his hand,
nor included any by which his high reputation would likely be
impaired, I have said all that seems necessary to be said, save that
the following letter came too late for insertion in its proper place:
it is characteristic and worth a place anywhere.</p>

<h2>TO DR. ARCHIBALD LAURIE.</h2>
<p class="sig"><i>Mossgiel, 13th Nov. 1786.</i></p>

<p class="sig7"><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,</p>

<p>I have along with this sent the two volumes of Ossian, with the
remaining volume of the Songs. Ossian I am not in such a hurry about;
but I wish the Songs, with the volume of the Scotch Poets, returned as
soon as they can conveniently be dispatched. If they are left at Mr.
Wilson, the bookseller&#8217;s shop, Kilmarnock, they will easily reach me.</p>

<p>My most respectful compliments to Mr. and Mrs. Laurie; and a Poet&#8217;s
warmest wishes for their happiness to the young ladies; particularly
the fair musician, whom I think much better qualified than ever David
was, or could be, to charm an evil spirit out of a Saul.</p>

<p>Indeed, it needs not the Feelings of a poet to be interested in the
welfare of one of the sweetest scenes of domestic peace and kindred
love that ever I saw; as I think the peaceful unity of St. Margaret&#8217;s
Hill can only be excelled by the harmonious concord of the Apocalyptic
Zion.</p>

<p class="sig11">I am, dear Sir, yours sincerely,</p>

OF<br />


ROBERT BURNS.</h2>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p>Robert Burns, the chief of the peasant poets of Scotland, was born in
a little mud-walled cottage on the banks of Doon, near &#8220;Alloway&#8217;s auld
haunted kirk,&#8221; in the shire of Ayr, on the 25th day of January, 1759.
As a natural mark of the event, a sudden storm at the same moment
swept the land: the gabel-wall of the frail dwelling gave way, and the
babe-bard was hurried through a tempest of wind and sleet to the
shelter of a securer hovel. He was the eldest born of three sons and
three daughters; his father, William, who in his native
Kincardineshire wrote his name Burness, was bred a gardener, and
sought for work in the West; but coming from the lands of the noble
family of the Keiths, a suspicion accompanied him that he had been
out&mdash;as rebellion was softly called&mdash;in the forty-five: a suspicion
fatal to his hopes of rest and bread, in so loyal a district; and it
was only when the clergyman of his native parish certified his loyalty
that he was permitted to toil. This suspicion of Jacobitism, revived
by Burns himself, when he rose into fame, seems not to have influenced
either the feelings, or the tastes of Agnes Brown, a young woman on
the Doon, whom he wooed and married in December, 1757, when he was
thirty-six years old. To support her, he leased a small piece of
ground, which he converted into a nursery and garden, and to shelter
her, he raised with his own hands that humble abode where she gave
birth to her eldest son.</p>

<p>The elder Burns was a well-informed, silent, austere man, who endured
no idle gaiety, nor indecorous language: while he relaxed somewhat the
hard, stern creed of the Covenanting times, he enforced all the
work-day, as well as sabbath-day observances, which the Calvinistic
kirk requires, and scrupled at promiscuous dancing, as the staid of
our own day scruple at the waltz. His wife was of a milder mood: she
was blest with a singular fortitude of temper; was as devout of heart,
as she was calm of mind; and loved, while busied in her household
concerns, to sweeten the bitterer moments of life, by chanting the
songs and ballads of her country, of which her store was great. The
garden and nursery prospered so much, that he was induced to widen his
views, and by the help of his kind landlord, the laird of Doonholm,
and the more questionable aid of borrowed money, he entered upon a
neighbouring farm, named Mount Oliphant, extending to an hundred
acres. This was in 1765; but the land was hungry and sterile; the
seasons proved rainy and rough; the toil was certain, the reward
unsure; when to his sorrow, the laird of Doonholm&mdash;a generous
Ferguson,&mdash;died: the strict terms of the lease, as well as the rent,
were exacted by a harsh factor, and with his wife and children, he was
obliged, after a losing struggle of six years, to relinquish the farm,
and seek shelter on the grounds of Lochlea, some ten miles off, in the
parish of Tarbolton. When, in after-days, men&#8217;s characters were in the
hands of his eldest son, the scoundrel factor sat for that lasting
portrait of insolence and wrong, in the &#8220;Twa Dogs.&#8221;</p>

<p>In this new farm William Burns seemed to strike root, and thrive. He
was strong of body and ardent of mind: every day brought increase of
vigour to his three sons, who, though very young,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxiv" id="Page_xxiv">[xxiv]</a></span> already put their
hands to the plough, the reap-hook, and the flail. But it seemed that
nothing which he undertook was decreed in the end to prosper: after
four seasons of prosperity a change ensued: the farm was far from
cheap; the gains under any lease were then so little, that the loss of
a few pounds was ruinous to a farmer: bad seed and wet seasons had
their usual influence: &#8220;The gloom of hermits and the moil of
galley-slaves,&#8221; as the poet, alluding to those days, said, were
endured to no purpose; when, to crown all, a difference arose between
the landlord and the tenant, as to the terms of the lease; and the
early days of the poet, and the declining years of his father, were
harassed by disputes, in which sensitive minds are sure to suffer.</p>

<p>Amid these labours and disputes, the poet&#8217;s father remembered the
worth of religious and moral instruction: he took part of this upon
himself. A week-day in Lochlea wore the sober looks of a Sunday: he
read the Bible and explained, as intelligent peasants are accustomed
to do, the sense, when dark or difficult; he loved to discuss the
spiritual meanings, and gaze on the mystical splendours of the
Revelations. He was aided in these labours, first, by the
schoolmaster of Alloway-mill, near the Doon; secondly, by John
Murdoch, student of divinity, who undertook to teach arithmetic,
grammar, French, and Latin, to the boys of Lochlea, and the sons of
five neighboring farmers. Murdoch, who was an enthusiast in learning,
much of a pedant, and such a judge of genius that he thought wit
should always be laughing, and poetry wear an eternal smile, performed
his task well: he found Robert to be quick in apprehension, and not
afraid to study when knowledge was the reward. He taught him to turn
verse into its natural prose order; to supply all the ellipses, and
not to desist till the sense was clear and plain: he also, in their
walks, told him the names of different objects both in Latin and
French; and though his knowledge of these languages never amounted to
much, he approached the grammar of the English tongue, through the
former, which was of material use to him, in his poetic compositions.
Burns was, even in those early days, a sort of enthusiast in all that
concerned the glory of Scotland; he used to fancy himself a soldier of
the days of the Wallace and the Bruce: loved to strut after the
bag-pipe and the drum, and read of the bloody struggles of his country
for freedom and existence, till &#8220;a Scottish prejudice,&#8221; he says, &#8220;was
poured into my veins, which will boil there till the flood-gates of
life are shut in eternal rest.&#8221;</p>

<p>In this mood of mind Burns was unconsciously approaching the land of
poesie. In addition to the histories of the Wallace and the Bruce, he
found, on the shelves of his neighbours, not only whole bodies of
divinity, and sermons without limit, but the works of some of the best
English, as well as Scottish poets, together with songs and ballads
innumerable. On these he loved to pore whenever a moment of leisure
came; nor was verse his sole favourite; he desired to drink knowledge
at any fountain, and Guthrie&#8217;s Grammar, Dickson on Agriculture,
Addison&#8217;s Spectator, Locke on the Human Understanding, and Taylor&#8217;s
Scripture Doctrine of Original Sin, were as welcome to his heart as
Shakspeare, Milton, Pope, Thomson, and Young. There is a mystery in
the workings of genius: with these poets in his head and hand, we see
not that he has advanced one step in the way in which he was soon to
walk, &#8220;Highland Mary&#8221; and &#8220;Tam O&#8217; Shanter&#8221; sprang from other
inspirations.</p>

<p>Burns lifts up the veil himself, from the studies which made him a
poet. &#8220;In my boyish days,&#8221; he says to Moore, &#8220;I owed much to an old
woman (Jenny Wilson) who resided in the family, remarkable for her
credulity and superstition. She had, I suppose, the largest collection
in the country of tales and songs, concerning devils, ghosts, fairies,
brownies, witches, warlocks, spunkies, kelpies, elf-candles,
dead-lights, wraiths, apparitions, cantraips, giants, enchanted
towers, dragons, and other trumpery. This cultivated the latent seeds
of poesie; but had so strong an effect upon my imagination that to
this hour, in my nocturnal rambles, I sometimes keep a look-out on
suspicious places.&#8221; Here we have the young poet taking lessons in the
classic lore of his native land: in the school of Janet Wilson he
profited largely; her tales gave a hue, all their own, to many noble
effusions. But her teaching was at the hearth-stone: when he was in
the fields, either driving a cart or walking to labour, he had ever in
his hand a collection of songs, such as any stall in the land could
supply him with; and over these he pored, ballad by ballad, and verse
by verse, noting the true, tender, and the natural sublime from
affectation and fustian. &#8220;To this,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I am convinced that I
owe much of my critic craft, such as it is.&#8221;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxv" id="Page_xxv">[xxv]</a></span> His mother, too,
unconsciously led him in the ways of the muse: she loved to recite or
sing to him a strange, but clever ballad, called &#8220;the Life and Age of
Man:&#8221; this strain of piety and imagination was in his mind when he
wrote &#8220;Man was made to Mourn.&#8221;</p>

<p>He found other teachers&mdash;of a tenderer nature and softer influence.
&#8220;You know,&#8221; he says to Moore, &#8220;our country custom of coupling a man
and woman together as partners in the labours of harvest. In my
fifteenth autumn my partner was a bewitching creature, a year younger
than myself: she was in truth a bonnie, sweet, sonsie lass, and
unwittingly to herself, initiated me in that delicious passion, which,
in spite of acid disappointment, gin-horse prudence, and bookworm
philosophy, I hold to be the first of human joys. How she caught the
contagion I cannot tell; I never expressly said I loved her: indeed I
did not know myself why I liked so much to loiter behind with her,
when returning in the evenings from our labours; why the tones of her
voice made my heart strings thrill like an &AElig;olian harp, and
particularly why my pulse beat such a furious ratan, when I looked and
fingered over her little hand, to pick out the cruel nettle-stings and
thistles. Among other love-inspiring qualities, she sang sweetly, and
it was her favourite reel to which I attempted to give an embodied
vehicle in rhyme; thus with me began love and verse.&#8221; This intercourse
with the fair part of the creation, was to his slumbering emotions, a
voice from heaven to call them into life and poetry.</p>

<p>From the school of traditionary lore and love, Burns now went to a
rougher academy. Lochlea, though not producing fine crops of corn, was
considered excellent for flax; and while the cultivation of this
commodity was committed to his father and his brother Gilbert, he was
sent to Irvine at Midsummer, 1781, to learn the trade of a
flax-dresser, under one Peacock, kinsman to his mother. Some time
before, he had spent a portion of a summer at a school in Kirkoswald,
learning mensuration and land-surveying, where he had mingled in
scenes of sociality with smugglers, and enjoyed the pleasure of a
silent walk, under the moon, with the young and the beautiful. At
Irvine he laboured by day to acquire a knowledge of his business, and
at night he associated with the gay and the thoughtless, with whom he
learnt to empty his glass, and indulge in free discourse on topics
forbidden at Lochlea. He had one small room for a lodging, for which
he gave a shilling a week: meat he seldom tasted, and his food
consisted chiefly of oatmeal and potatoes sent from his father&#8217;s
house. In a letter to his father, written with great purity and
simplicity of style, he thus gives a picture of himself, mental and
bodily: &#8220;Honoured Sir, I have purposely delayed writing, in the hope
that I should have the pleasure of seeing you on new years&#8217; day, but
work comes so hard upon us that I do not choose to be absent on that
account. My health is nearly the same as when you were here, only my
sleep is a little sounder, and on the whole, I am rather better than
otherwise, though I mend by very slow degrees: the weakness of my
nerves had so debilitated my mind that I dare neither review past
wants nor look forward into futurity, for the least anxiety or
perturbation in my breast produces most unhappy effects on my whole
frame. Sometimes indeed, when for an hour or two my spirits are a
little lightened, I <i>glimmer</i> a little into futurity; but my principal
and indeed my only pleasurable employment is looking backwards and
forwards in a moral and religious way. I am quite transported at the
thought that ere long, perhaps very soon, I shall bid an eternal adieu
to all the pains and uneasinesses, and disquietudes of this weary
life. As for the world, I despair of ever making a figure in it: I am
not formed for the bustle of the busy, nor the flutter of the gay. I
foresee that poverty and obscurity probably await me, and I am in some
measure prepared and daily preparing to meet them. I have but just
time and paper to return you my grateful thanks for the lessons of
virtue and piety you have given me, which were but too much neglected
at the time of giving them, but which, I hope, have been remembered
ere it is yet too late.&#8221; This remarkable letter was written in the
twenty-second year of his age; it alludes to the illness which seems
to have been the companion of his youth, a nervous headache, brought
on by constant toil and anxiety; and it speaks of the melancholy which
is the common attendant of genius, and its sensibilities, aggravated
by despair of distinction. The catastrophe which happened ere this
letter was well in his father&#8217;s hand, accords ill with quotations from
the Bible, and hopes fixed in heaven:&mdash;&#8220;As we gave,&#8221; he says, &#8220;a
welcome carousal to the new year, the shop took fire, and burnt to
ashes, and I was left, like a true poet, not worth a sixpence.&#8221;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxvi" id="Page_xxvi">[xxvi]</a></span></p>

<p>This disaster was followed by one more grievous: his father was well
in years when he was married, and age and a constitution injured by
toil and disappointment, began to press him down, ere his sons had
grown up to man&#8217;s estate. On all sides the clouds began to darken: the
farm was unprosperous: the speculations in flax failed; and the
landlord of Lochlea, raising a question upon the meaning of the lease,
concerning rotation of crop, pushed the matter to a lawsuit, alike
ruinous to a poor man either in its success or its failure. &#8220;After
three years tossing and whirling,&#8221; says Burns, &#8220;in the vortex of
litigation, my father was just saved from the horrors of a jail by a
consumption, which, after two years&#8217; promises, kindly slept in and
carried him away to where the &#8216;wicked cease from troubling and the
weary are at rest.&#8217; His all went among the hell-hounds that prowl in
the kennel of justice. The finishing evil which brought up the rear of
this infernal file, was my constitutional melancholy being increased
to such a degree, that for three months I was in a state of mind
scarcely to be envied by the hopeless wretches who have got their
mittimus, &#8216;Depart from me, ye cursed.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Robert Burns was now the head of his father&#8217;s house. He gathered
together the little that law and misfortune had spared, and took the
farm of Mossgiel, near Mauchline, containing one hundred and eighteen
acres, at a rent of ninety pounds a year: his mother and sisters took
the domestic superintendence of home, barn, and byre; and he
associated his brother Gilbert in the labours of the land. It was made
a joint affair: the poet was young, willing, and vigorous, and
excelled in ploughing, sowing, reaping, mowing, and thrashing. His
wages were fixed at seven pounds per annum, and such for a time was
his care and frugality, that he never exceeded this small allowance.
He purchased books on farming, held conversations with the old and the
knowing; and said unto himself, &#8220;I shall be prudent and wise, and my
shadow shall increase in the land.&#8221; But it was not decreed that these
resolutions were to endure, and that he was to become a mighty
agriculturist in the west. Farmer Attention, as the proverb says, is a
good farmer, all the world over, and Burns was such by fits and by
starts. But he who writes an ode on the sheep he is about to shear, a
poem on the flower that he covers with the furrow, who sees visions on
his way to market, who makes rhymes on the horse he is about to yoke,
and a song on the girl who shows the whitest hands among his reapers,
has small chance of leading a market, or of being laird of the fields
he rents. The dreams of Burns were of the muses, and not of rising
markets, of golden locks rather than of yellow corn: he had other
faults. It is not known that William Burns was aware before his death
that his eldest son had sinned in rhyme; but we have Gilbert&#8217;s
assurance, that his father went to the grave in ignorance of his son&#8217;s
errors of a less venial kind&mdash;unwitting that he was soon to give a
two-fold proof of both in &#8220;Rob the Rhymer&#8217;s Address to his Bastard
Child&#8221;&mdash;a poem less decorous than witty.</p>

<p>The dress and condition of Burns when he became a poet were not at all
poetical, in the minstrel meaning of the word. His clothes, coarse and
homely, were made from home-grown wool, shorn off his own sheeps&#8217;
backs, carded and spun at his own fireside, woven by the village
weaver, and, when not of natural hodden-gray, dyed a half-blue in the
village vat. They were shaped and sewed by the district tailor, who
usually wrought at the rate of a groat a day and his food; and as the
wool was coarse, so also was the workmanship. The linen which he wore
was home-grown, home-hackled, home-spun, home-woven, and
home-bleached, and, unless designed for Sunday use, was of coarse,
strong harn, to suit the tear and wear of barn and field. His shoes
came from rustic tanpits, for most farmers then prepared their own
leather; were armed, sole and heel, with heavy, broad-headed nails, to
endure the clod and the road: as hats were then little in use, save
among small lairds or country gentry, westland heads were commonly
covered with a coarse, broad, blue bonnet, with a stopple on its flat
crown, made in thousands at Kilmarnock, and known in all lands by the
name of scone bonnets. His plaid was a handsome red and white
check&mdash;for pride in poets, he said, was no sin&mdash;prepared of fine wool
with more than common care by the hands of his mother and sisters, and
woven with more skill than the village weaver was usually required to
exert. His dwelling was in keeping with his dress, a low, thatched
house, with a kitchen, a bedroom and closet, with floors of kneaded
clay, and ceilings of moorland turf: a few books on a shelf, thumbed
by many a thumb; a few hams drying above head in the smoke,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxvii" id="Page_xxvii">[xxvii]</a></span> which was
in no haste to get out at the roof&mdash;a wooden settle, some oak chairs,
chaff beds well covered with blankets, with a fire of peat and wood
burning at a distance from the gable wall, on the middle of the floor.
His food was as homely as his habitation, and consisted chiefly of
oatmeal-porridge, barley-broth, and potatoes, and milk. How the muse
happened to visit him in this clay biggin, take a fancy to a clouterly
peasant, and teach him strains of consummate beauty and elegance, must
ever be a matter of wonder to all those, and they are not few, who
hold that noble sentiments and heroic deeds are the exclusive portion
of the gently nursed and the far descended.</p>

<p>Of the earlier verses of Burns few are preserved: when composed, he
put them on paper, but the kept them to himself: though a poet at
sixteen, he seems not to have made even his brother his confidante
till he became a man, and his judgment had ripened. He, however, made
a little clasped paper book his treasurer, and under the head of
&#8220;Observations, Hints, Songs, and Scraps of Poetry,&#8221; we find many a
wayward and impassioned verse, songs rising little above the humblest
country strain, or bursting into an elegance and a beauty worthy of
the highest of minstrels. The first words noted down are the stanzas
which he composed on his fair companion of the harvest-field, out of
whose hands he loved to remove the nettle-stings and the thistles: the
prettier song, beginning &#8220;Now westlin win&#8217;s and slaughtering guns,&#8221;
written on the lass of Kirkoswald, with whom, instead of learning
mensuration, he chose to wander under the light of the moon: a strain
better still, inspired by the charms of a neighbouring maiden, of the
name of Annie Ronald; another, of equal merit, arising out of his
nocturnal adventures among the lasses of the west; and, finally, that
crowning glory of all his lyric compositions, &#8220;Green grow the rashes.&#8221;
This little clasped book, however, seems not to have been made his
confidante till his twenty-third or twenty-fourth year: he probably
admitted to its pages only the strains which he loved most, or such as
had taken a place in his memory: at whatever age it was commenced, he
had then begun to estimate his own character, and intimate his
fortunes, for he calls himself in its pages &#8220;a man who had little art
in making money, and still less in keeping it.&#8221;</p>

<p>We have not been told how welcome the incense of his songs rendered
him to the rustic maidens of Kyle: women are not apt to be won by the
charms of verse; they have little sympathy with dreamers on Parnassus,
and allow themselves to be influenced by something more substantial
than the roses and lilies of the muse. Burns had other claims to their
regard then those arising from poetic skill: he was tall, young,
good-looking, with dark, bright eyes, and words and wit at will: he
had a sarcastic sally for all lads who presumed to cross his path, and
a soft, persuasive word for all lasses on whom he fixed his fancy: nor
was this all&mdash;he was adventurous and bold in love trystes and love
excursions: long, rough roads, stormy nights, flooded rivers, and
lonesome places, were no letts to him; and when the dangers or labours
of the way were braved, he was alike skilful in eluding vigilant
aunts, wakerife mothers, and envious or suspicions sisters: for rivals
he had a blow as ready us he had a word, and was familiar with snug
stack-yards, broomy glens, and nooks of hawthorn and honeysuckle,
where maidens love to be wooed. This rendered him dearer to woman&#8217;s
heart than all the lyric effusions of his fancy; and when we add to
such allurements, a warm, flowing, and persuasive eloquence, we need
not wonder that woman listened and was won; that one of the most
charming damsels of the West said, an hour with him in the dark was
worth a lifetime of light with any other body; or that the
accomplished and beautiful Duchess of Gordon declared, in a latter
day, that no man ever carried her so completely off her feet as Robert
Burns.</p>

<p>It is one of the delusions of the poet&#8217;s critics and biographers, that
the sources of his inspiration are to be found in the great classic
poets of the land, with some of whom he had from his youth been
familiar: there is little or no trace of them in any of his
compositions. He read and wondered&mdash;he warmed his fancy at their
flame, he corrected his own natural taste by theirs, but he neither
copied nor imitated, and there are but two or three allusions to Young
and Shakspeare in all the range of his verse. He could not but feel
that he was the scholar of a different school, and that his thirst was
to be slaked at other fountains. The language in which those great
bards embodied their thoughts was unapproachable to an Ayrshire
peasant; it was to him as an almost foreign tongue: he had to think
and feel in the not ungraceful or inharmonious<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxviii" id="Page_xxviii">[xxviii]</a></span> language of his own
vale, and then, in a manner, translate it into that of Pope or of
Thomson, with the additional difficulty of finding English words to
express the exact meaning of those of Scotland, which had chiefly been
retained because equivalents could not be found in the more elegant
and grammatical tongue. Such strains as those of the polished Pope or
the sublimer Milton were beyond his power, less from deficiency of
genius than from lack of language: he could, indeed, write English
with ease and fluency; but when he desired to be tender or
impassioned, to persuade or subdue, he had recourse to the Scottish,
and he found it sufficient.</p>

<p>The goddesses or the Dalilahs of the young poet&#8217;s song were, like the
language in which he celebrated them, the produce of the district; not
dames high and exalted, but lasses of the barn and of the byre, who
had never been in higher company than that of shepherds or ploughmen,
or danced in a politer assembly than that of their fellow-peasants, on
a barn-floor, to the sound of the district fiddle. Nor even of these
did he choose the loveliest to lay out the wealth of his verse upon:
he has been accused, by his brother among others, of lavishing the
colours of his fancy on very ordinary faces. &#8220;He had always,&#8221; says
Gilbert, &#8220;a jealousy of people who were richer than himself; his love,
therefore, seldom settled on persons of this description. When he
selected any one, out of the sovereignty of his good pleasure, to whom
he should pay his particular attention, she was instantly invested
with a sufficient stock of charms out of the plentiful stores of his
own imagination: and there was often a great dissimilitude between his
fair captivator, as she appeared to others and as she seemed when
invested with the attributes he gave her.&#8221; &#8220;My heart,&#8221; he himself,
speaking of those days, observes, &#8220;was completely tinder, and was
eternally lighted up by some goddess or other.&#8221; Yet, it must be
acknowledged that sufficient room exists for believing that Burns and
his brethren of the West had very different notions of the captivating
and the beautiful; while they were moved by rosy checks and looks of
rustic health, he was moved, like a sculptor, by beauty of form or by
harmony of motion, and by expression, which lightened up ordinary
features and rendered them captivating. Such, I have been told, were
several of the lasses of the West, to whom, if he did not surrender
his heart, he rendered homage: and both elegance of form and beauty of
face were visible to all in those of whom he afterwards sang&mdash;the
Hamiltons and the Burnets of Edinburgh, and the Millers and M&#8217;Murdos
of the Nith.</p>

<p>The mind of Burns took now a wider range: he had sung of the maidens
of Kyle in strains not likely soon to die, and though not weary of the
softnesses of love, he desired to try his genius on matters of a
sterner kind&mdash;what those subjects were he tells us; they were homely
and at hand, of a native nature and of Scottish growth: places
celebrated in Roman story, vales made famous in Grecian song&mdash;hills of
vines and groves of myrtle had few charms for him. &#8220;I am hurt,&#8221; thus
he writes in August, 1785, &#8220;to see other towns, rivers, woods, and
haughs of Scotland immortalized in song, while my dear native county,
the ancient Baillieries of Carrick, Kyle, and Cunningham, famous in
both ancient and modern times for a gallant and warlike race of
inhabitants&mdash;a county where civil and religious liberty have ever
found their first support and their asylum&mdash;a county, the birth-place
of many famous philosophers, soldiers, and statesmen, and the scene of
many great events recorded in history, particularly the actions of the
glorious Wallace&mdash;yet we have never had one Scotch poet of any
eminence to make the fertile banks of Irvine, the romantic woodlands
and sequestered scenes of Ayr. and the mountainous source and winding
sweep of the Doon, emulate Tay, Forth, Ettrick, and Tweed. This is a
complaint I would gladly remedy, but, alas! I am far unequal to the
task, both in genius and education.&#8221; To fill up with glowing verse the
outline which this sketch indicates, was to raise the long-laid spirit
of national song&mdash;to waken a strain to which the whole land would
yield response&mdash;a miracle unattempted&mdash;certainly unperformed&mdash;since
the days of the Gentle Shepherd. It is true that the tongue of the
muse had at no time been wholly silent; that now and then a burst of
sublime woe, like the song of &#8220;Mary, weep no more for me,&#8221; and of
lasting merriment and humour, like that of &#8220;Tibbie Fowler,&#8221; proved
that the fire of natural poesie smouldered, if it did not blaze; while
the social strains of the unfortunate Fergusson revived in the city,
if not in the field, the memory of him who sang the &#8220;Monk and the
Miller&#8217;s wife.&#8221; But notwithstanding these and other productions of
equal merit, Scottish poesie, it must be owned, had lost much of its
original ecstasy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxix" id="Page_xxix">[xxix]</a></span> and fervour, and that the boldest efforts of the
muse no more equalled the songs of Dunbar, of Douglas, of Lyndsay, and
of James the Fifth, than the sound of an artificial cascade resembles
the undying thunders of Corra.</p>

<p>To accomplish this required an acquaintance with man beyond what the
forge, the change-house, and the market-place of the village supplied;
a look further than the barn-yard and the furrowed field, and a
livelier knowledge and deeper feeling of history than, probably, Burns
ever possessed. To all ready and accessible sources of knowledge he
appears to have had recourse; he sought matter for his muse in the
meetings, religious as well as social, of the district&mdash;consorted with
staid matrons, grave plodding farmers&mdash;with those who preached as well
as those who listened&mdash;with sharp-tongued attorneys, who laid down the
law over a Mauchline gill&mdash;with country squires, whose wisdom was
great in the game-laws, and in contested elections&mdash;and with roving
smugglers, who at that time hung, as a cloud, on all the western coast
of Scotland. In the company of farmers and fellow-peasants, he
witnessed scenes which he loved to embody in verse, saw pictures of
peace and joy, now woven into the web of his song, and had a poetic
impulse given to him both by cottage devotion and cottage merriment.
If he was familiar with love and all its outgoings and incomings&mdash;had
met his lass in the midnight shade, or walked with her under the moon,
or braved a stormy night and a haunted road for her sake&mdash;he was as
well acquainted with the joys which belong to social intercourse, when
instruments of music speak to the feet, when the reek of punchbowls
gives a tongue to the staid and demure, and bridal festivity, and
harvest-homes, bid a whole valley lift up its voice and be glad. It is
more difficult to decide what poetic use he could make of his
intercourse with that loose and lawless class of men, who, from love
of gain, broke the laws and braved the police of their country: that
he found among smugglers, as he says, &#8220;men of noble virtues,
magnanimity, generosity, disinterested friendship, and modesty,&#8221; is
easier to believe than that he escaped the contamination of their
sensual manners and prodigality. The people of Kyle regarded this
conduct with suspicion: they were not to be expected to know that when
Burns ranted and housed with smugglers, conversed with tinkers huddled
in a kiln, or listened to the riotous mirth of a batch of &#8220;randie
gangrel bodies&#8221; as they &#8220;toomed their powks and pawned their duds,&#8221;
for liquor in Poosie Nansie&#8217;s, he was taking sketches for the future
entertainment and instruction of the world; they could not foresee
that from all this moral strength and poetic beauty would arise.</p>

<p>While meditating something better than a ballad to his mistress&#8217;s
eyebrow, he did not neglect to lay out the little skill he had in
cultivating the grounds of Mossgiel. The prosperity in which he found
himself in the first and second seasons, induced him to hope that good
fortune had not yet forsaken him: a genial summer and a good market
seldom come together to the farmer, but at first they came to Burns;
and to show that he was worthy of them, he bought books on
agriculture, calculated rotation of crops, attended sales, held the
plough with diligence, used the scythe, the reap-hook, and the flail,
with skill, and the malicious even began to say that there was
something more in him than wild sallies of wit and foolish rhymes. But
the farm lay high, the bottom was wet, and in a third season,
indifferent seed and a wet harvest robbed him at once of half his
crop: he seems to have regarded this as an intimation from above, that
nothing which he undertook would prosper: and consoled himself with
joyous friends and with the society of the muse. The judgment cannot
be praised which selected a farm with a wet cold bottom, and sowed it
with unsound seed; but that man who despairs because a wet season robs
him of the fruits of the field, is unfit for the warfare of life,
where fortitude is as much required as by a general on a field of
battle, when the tide of success threatens to flow against him. The
poet seems to have believed, very early in life, that he was none of
the elect of Mammon; that he was too much of a genius ever to acquire
wealth by steady labour, or by, as he loved to call it, gin-horse
prudence, or grubbing industry.</p>

<p>And yet there were hours and days in which Burns, even when the rain
fell on his unhoused sheaves, did not wholly despair of himself: he
laboured, nay sometimes he slaved on his farm; and at intervals of
toil, sought to embellish his mind with such knowledge as might be
useful, should chance, the goddess who ruled his lot, drop him upon
some of the higher places of the land. He had, while he lived at
Tarbolton, united with some half-dozen young men, all sons of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxx" id="Page_xxx">[xxx]</a></span> farmers
in that neighbourhood, in forming a club, of which the object was to
charm away a few evening hours in the week with agreeable chit-chat,
and the discussion of topics of economy or love. Of this little
society the poet was president, and the first question they were
called on to settle was this, &#8220;Suppose a young man bred a farmer, but
without any fortune, has it in his power to marry either of two women;
the one a girl of large fortune, but neither handsome in person, nor
agreeable in conversation, but who can manage the household affairs of
a farm well enough; the other of them, a girl every way agreeable in
person, conversation, and behaviour, but without any fortune, which of
them shall he choose?&#8221; This question was started by the poet, and once
every week the club were called to the consideration of matters
connected with rural life and industry: their expenses were limited to
threepence a week; and till the departure of Burns to the distant
Mossgiel, the club continued to live and thrive; on his removal it
lost the spirit which gave it birth, and was heard of no more; but its
aims and its usefulness were revived in Mauchline, where the poet was
induced to establish a society which only differed from the other in
spending the moderate fines arising from non-attendance, on books,
instead of liquor. Here, too, Burns was the president, and the members
were chiefly the sons of husbandmen, whom he found, he said, more
natural in their manners, and more agreeable than the self-sufficient
mechanics of villages and towns, who were ready to dispute on all
topics, and inclined to be convinced on none. This club had the
pleasure of subscribing for the first edition of the works of its
great associate. It has been questioned by his first biographer,
whether the refinement of mind, which follows the reading of books of
eloquence and delicacy,&mdash;the mental improvement resulting from such
calm discussions as the Tarbolton and Mauchline clubs indulged in, was
not injurious to men engaged in the barn and at the plough. A
well-ordered mind will be strengthened, as well as embellished, by
elegant knowledge, while over those naturally barren and ungenial all
that is refined or noble will pass as a sunny shower scuds over lumps
of granite, bringing neither warmth nor life.</p>

<p>In the account which the poet gives to Moore of his early poems, he
says little about his exquisite lyrics, and less about &#8220;The Death and
dying Words of Poor Mailie,&#8221; or her &#8220;Elegy,&#8221; the first of his poems
where the inspiration of the muse is visible; but he speaks with
exultation of the fame which those indecorous sallies, &#8220;Holy Willie&#8217;s
Prayer&#8221; and &#8220;The Holy Tulzie&#8221; brought from some of the clergy, and the
people of Ayrshire. The west of Scotland is ever in the van, when
mutters either political or religious are agitated. Calvinism was
shaken, at this time, with a controversy among its professors, of
which it is enough to say, that while one party rigidly adhered to the
word and letter of the Confession of Faith, and preached up the palmy
and wholesome days of the Covenant, the other sought to soften the
harsher rules and observances of the kirk, and to bring moderation and
charity into its discipline as well as its councils. Both believed
themselves right, both were loud and hot, and personal,&mdash;bitter with a
bitterness only known in religious controversy. The poet sided with
the professors of the New Light, as the more tolerant were called, and
handled the professors of the Old Light, as the other party were
named, with the most unsparing severity. For this he had sufficient
cause:&mdash;he had experienced the mercilessness of kirk-discipline, when
his frailties caused him to visit the stool of repentance; and
moreover his friend Gavin Hamilton, a writer in Mauchline, had been
sharply censured by the same authorities, for daring to gallop on
Sundays. Moodie, of Riccarton, and Russel, of Kilmarnock, were the
first who tasted of the poet&#8217;s wrath. They, though professors of the
Old Light, had quarrelled, and, it is added, fought: &#8220;The Holy
Tulzie,&#8221; which recorded, gave at the same time wings to the scandal;
while for &#8220;Holy Willie,&#8221; an elder of Mauchline, and an austere and
hollow pretender to righteousness, he reserved the fiercest of all his
lampoons. In &#8220;Holy Willie&#8217;s Prayer,&#8221; he lays a burning hand on the
terrible doctrine of predestination: this is a satire, daring,
personal, and profane. Willie claims praise in the singular,
acknowledges folly in the plural, and makes heaven accountable for his
sins! in a similar strain of undevout satire, he congratulates Goudie,
of Kilmarnock, on his Essays on Revealed Religion. These poems,
particularly the two latter, are the sharpest lampoons in the
language.</p>

<p>While drudging in the cause of the New Light controversialists, Burns
was not unconsciously strengthening his hands for worthier toils: the
applause which selfish divines bestowed on his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxxi" id="Page_xxxi">[xxxi]</a></span> witty, but graceless
effusions, could not be enough for one who knew how fleeting the fame
was which came from the heat of party disputes; nor was he insensible
that songs of a beauty unknown for a century to national poesy, had
been unregarded in the hue and cry which arose on account of &#8220;Holy
Willie&#8217;s Prayer&#8221; and &#8220;The Holy Tulzie.&#8221; He hesitated to drink longer
out of the agitated puddle of Calvinistic controversy, he resolved to
slake his thirst at the pure well-springs of patriot feeling and
domestic love; and accordingly, in the last and best of his
controversial compositions, he rose out of the lower regions of
lampoon into the upper air of true poetry. &#8220;The Holy Fair,&#8221; though
stained in one or two verses with personalities, exhibits a scene
glowing with character and incident and life: the aim of the poem is
not so much to satirize one or two Old Light divines, as to expose and
rebuke those almost indecent festivities, which in too many of the
western parishes accompanied the administration of the sacrament. In
the earlier days of the church, when men were staid and sincere, it
was, no doubt, an impressive sight to see rank succeeding rank, of the
old and the young, all calm and all devout, seated before the tent of
the preacher, in the sunny hours of June, listening to his eloquence,
or partaking of the mystic bread and wine; but in these our latter
days, when discipline is relaxed, along with the sedate and the pious
come swarms of the idle and the profligate, whom no eloquence can
edify and no solemn rite affect. On these, and such as these, the poet
has poured his satire; and since this desirable reprehension the Holy
Fairs, east as well as west, have become more decorous, if not more
devout.</p>

<p>His controversial sallies were accompanied, or followed, by a series
of poems which showed that national character and manners, as Lockhart
has truly and happily said, were once more in the hands of a national
poet. These compositions are both numerous and various: they record
the poet&#8217;s own experience and emotions; they exhibit the highest moral
feeling, the purest patriotic sentiments, and a deep sympathy with the
fortunes, both here and hereafter of his fellow-men; they delineate
domestic manners, man&#8217;s stern as well as social hours, and mingle the
serious with the joyous, the sarcastic with the solemn, the mournful
with the pathetic, the amiable with the gay, and all with an ease and
unaffected force and freedom known only to the genius of Shakspeare.
In &#8220;The Twa Dogs&#8221; he seeks to reconcile the labourer to his lot, and
intimates, by examples drawn from the hall as well as the cottage,
that happiness resides in the humblest abodes, and is even partial to
the clouted shoe. In &#8220;Scotch Drink&#8221; he excites man to love his
country, by precepts both heroic and social; and proves that while
wine and brandy are the tipple of slaves, whiskey and ale are the
drink of the free: sentiments of a similar kind distinguish his
&#8220;Earnest Cry and Prayer to the Scotch Representatives in the House of
Commons,&#8221; each of whom he exhorts by name to defend the remaining
liberties and immunities of his country. A higher tone distinguishes
the &#8220;Address to the Deil:&#8221; he records all the names, and some of them
are strange ones; and all the acts, and some of them are as whimsical
as they are terrible, of this far kenned and noted personage; to these
he adds some of the fiend&#8217;s doings as they stand in Scripture,
together with his own experiences; and concludes by a hope, as
unexpected as merciful and relenting, that Satan may not be exposed to
an eternity of torments. &#8220;The Dream&#8221; is a humorous sally, and may be
almost regarded as prophetic. The poet feigns himself present, in
slumber, at the Royal birth-day; and supposes that he addresses his
majesty, on his household matters as well as the affairs of the
nation. Some of the princes, it has been satirically hinted, behaved
afterwards in such a way as if they wished that the scripture of the
Burns should be fulfilled: in this strain, he has imitated the license
and equalled the wit of some of the elder Scottish Poets.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Vision&#8221; is wholly serious; it exhibits the poet in one of those
fits of despondency which the dull, who have no misgivings, never
know: he dwells with sarcastic bitterness on the opportunities which,
for the sake of song, he has neglected of becoming wealthy, and is
drawing a sad parallel between rags and riches, when the muse steps in
and cheer his despondency, by assuring him of undying fame.
&#8220;Halloween&#8221; is a strain of a more homely kind, recording the
superstitious beliefs, and no less superstitious doings of Old
Scotland, on that night, when witches and elves and evil spirits are
let loose among the children of men: it reaches far back into manners
and customs, and is a picture, curious and valuable. The tastes and
feelings of husbandmen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxxii" id="Page_xxxii">[xxxii]</a></span> inspired &#8220;The old Farmer&#8217;s Address to his old
mare Maggie,&#8221; which exhibits some pleasing recollections of his days
of courtship and hours of sociality. The calm, tranquil picture of
household happiness and devotion in &#8220;the Cotter&#8217;s Saturday Night,&#8221; has
induced Hogg, among others, to believe that it has less than usual of
the spirit of the poet, but it has all the spirit that was required;
the toil of the week has ceased, the labourer has returned to his
well-ordered home&mdash;his &#8220;cozie ingle and his clean hearth-stane,&#8221;&mdash;and
with his wife and children beside him, turns his thoughts to the
praise of that God to whom he owes all: this he performs with a
reverence and an awe, at once natural, national, and poetic. &#8220;The
Mouse&#8221; is a brief and happy and very moving poem: happy, for it
delineates, with wonderful truth and life, the agitation of the mouse
when the coulter broke into its abode; and moving, for the poet takes
the lesson of ruin to himself, and feels the present and dreads the
future. &#8220;The Mountain Daisy,&#8221; once, more properly, called by Burns
&#8220;The Gowan,&#8221; resembles &#8220;The Mouse&#8221; in incident and in moral, and is
equally happy, in language and conception. &#8220;The Lament&#8221; is a dark, and
all but tragic page, from the poet&#8217;s own life. &#8220;Man was made to
Mourn&#8217;&#8221; takes the part of the humble and the homeless, against the
coldness and selfishness of the wealthy and the powerful, a favourite
topic of meditation with Burns. He refrained, for awhile, from making
&#8220;Death and Doctor Hernbook&#8221; public; a poem which deviates from the
offensiveness of personal satire, into a strain of humour, at once
airy and original.</p>

<p>His epistles in verse may be reckoned amongst his happiest
productions: they are written in all moods of mind, and are, by turns,
lively and sad; careless and serious;&mdash;now giving advice, then taking
it; laughing at learning, and lamenting its want; scoffing at
propriety and wealth, yet admitting, that without the one he cannot be
wise, nor wanting the other, independent. The Epistle to David Sillar
is the first of these compositions: the poet has no news to tell, and
no serious question to ask: he has only to communicate his own
emotions of joy, or of sorrow, and these he relates and discusses with
singular elegance as well as ease, twining, at the same time, into the
fabric of his composition, agreeable allusions to the taste and
affections of his correspondent. He seems to have rated the intellect
of Sillar as the highest among his rustic friends: he pays him more
deference, and addresses him in a higher vein than he observes to
others. The Epistles to Lapraik, to Smith, and to Rankine, are in a
more familiar, or social mood, and lift the veil from the darkness of
the poet&#8217;s condition, and exhibit a mind of first-rate power, groping,
and that surely, its way to distinction, in spite of humility of
birth, obscurity of condition, and the coldness of the wealthy or the
titled. The epistles of other poets owe some of their fame to the rank
or the reputation of those to whom they are addressed; those of Burns
are written, one and all, to nameless and undistinguished men. Sillar
was a country schoolmaster, Lapraik a moorland laird, Smith a small
shop-keeper, and Rankine a farmer, who loved a gill and a joke. Yet
these men were the chief friends, the only literary associates of the
poet, during those early years, in which, with some exceptions, his
finest works were written.</p>

<p>Burns, while he was writing the poems, the chief of which we have
named, was a labouring husbandman on the little farm of Mossgiel, a
pursuit which affords but few leisure hours for either reading or
pondering; but to him the stubble-field was musing-ground, and the
walk behind the plough, a twilight saunter on Parnassus. As, with a
careful hand and a steady eye, he guided his horses, and saw an evenly
furrow turned up by the share, his thoughts were on other themes; he
was straying in haunted glens, when spirits have power&mdash;looking in
fancy on the lasses &#8220;skelping barefoot,&#8221; in silks and in scarlets, to
a field-preaching&mdash;walking in imagination with the rosy widow, who on
Halloween ventured to dip her left sleeve in the burn, where three
lairds&#8217; lands met&mdash;making the &#8220;bottle clunk,&#8221; with joyous smugglers,
on a lucky run of gin or brandy&mdash;or if his thoughts at all approached
his acts&mdash;he was moralizing on the daisy oppressed by the furrow which
his own ploughshare had turned. That his thoughts were thus wandering
we have his own testimony, with that of his brother Gilbert; and were
both wanting, the certainty that he composed the greater part of his
immortal poems in two years, from the summer of 1784 to the summer of
1786, would be evidence sufficient. The muse must have been strong
within him, when, in spite of the rains and sleets of the
&#8220;ever-dropping west&#8221;&mdash;when in defiance of the hot and sweaty brows
occasioned by reaping and thrashing&mdash;declining markets, and showery<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxxiii" id="Page_xxxiii">[xxxiii]</a></span>
harvests&mdash;the clamour of his laird for his rent, and the tradesman for
his account, he persevered in song, and sought solace in verse, when
all other solace was denied him.</p>

<p>The circumstances under which his principal poems were composed, have
been related: the &#8220;Lament of Mailie&#8221; found its origin in the
catastrophe of a pet ewe; the &#8220;Epistle to Sillar&#8221; was confided by the
poet to his brother while they were engaged in weeding the kale-yard;
the &#8220;Address to the Deil&#8221; was suggested by the many strange portraits
which belief or fear had drawn of Satan, and was repeated by the one
brother to the other, on the way with their carts to the kiln, for
lime; the &#8220;Cotter&#8217;s Saturday Night&#8221; originated in the reverence with
which the worship of God was conducted in the family of the poet&#8217;s
father, and in the solemn tone with which he desired his children to
compose themselves for praise and prayer; &#8220;the Mouse,&#8221; and its moral
companion &#8220;the Daisy,&#8221; were the offspring of the incidents which they
relate; and &#8220;Death and Doctor Hornbook&#8221; was conceived at a
freemason-meeting, where the hero of the piece had shown too much of
the pedant, and composed on his way home, after midnight, by the poet,
while his head was somewhat dizzy with drink. One of the most
remarkable of his compositions, the &#8220;Jolly Beggars,&#8221; a drama, to which
nothing in the language of either the North or South can be compared,
and which was unknown till after the death of the author, was
suggested by a scene which he saw in a low ale-house, into which, on a
Saturday night, most of the sturdy beggars of the district had met to
sell their meal, pledge their superfluous rags, and drink their gains.
It may be added, that he loved to walk in solitary spots; that his
chief musing-ground was the banks of the Ayr; the season most
congenial to his fancy that of winter, when the winds were heard in
the leafless woods, and the voice of the swollen streams came from
vale and hill; and that he seldom composed a whole poem at once, but
satisfied with a few fervent verses, laid the subject aside, till the
muse summoned him to another exertion of fancy. In a little back
closet, still existing in the farm-house of Mossgiel, he committed
most of his poems to paper.</p>

<p>But while the poet rose, the farmer sank. It was not the cold clayey
bottom of his ground, nor the purchase of unsound seed-corn, not the
fluctuation in the markets alone, which injured him; neither was it
the taste for freemason socialities, nor a desire to join the mirth of
comrades, either of the sea or the shore: neither could it be wholly
imputed to his passionate following of the softer sex&mdash;indulgence in
the &#8220;illicit rove,&#8221; or giving way to his eloquence at the feet of one
whom he loved and honoured; other farmers indulged in the one, or
suffered from the other, yet were prosperous. His want of success
arose from other causes; his heart was not with his task, save by fits
and starts: he felt he was designed for higher purposes than
ploughing, and harrowing, and sowing, and reaping: when the sun called
on him, after a shower, to come to the plough, or when the ripe corn
invited the sickle, or the ready market called for the measured grain,
the poet was under other spells, and was slow to avail himself of
those golden moments which come but once in the season. To this may be
added, a too superficial knowledge of the art of farming, and a want
of intimacy with the nature of the soil he was called to cultivate. He
could speak fluently of leas, and faughs, and fallows, of change of
seed and rotation of crops, but practical knowledge and application
were required, and in these Burns was deficient. The moderate gain
which those dark days of agriculture brought to the economical farmer,
was not obtained: the close, the all but niggardly care by which he
could win and keep his crown-piece,&mdash;gold was seldom in the farmer&#8217;s
hand,&mdash;was either above or below the mind of the poet, and Mossgiel,
which, in the hands of an assiduous farmer, might have made a
reasonable return for labour, was unproductive, under one who had
little skill, less economy, and no taste for the task.</p>

<p>Other reasons for his failure have been assigned. It is to the credit
of the moral sentiments of the husbandmen of Scotland, that when one
of their class forgets what virtue requires, and dishonours, without
reparation, even the humblest of the maidens, he is not allowed to go
unpunished. No proceedings take place, perhaps one hard word is not
spoken; but he is regarded with loathing by the old and the devout; he
is looked on by all with cold and reproachful eyes&mdash;sorrow is foretold
as his lot, sure disaster as his fortune; and is these chance to
arrive, the only sympathy expressed is, &#8220;What better could he expect?&#8221;
Something of this sort befel Burns: he had already satisfied the kirk
in the matter of &#8220;Sonsie, smirking, dear-bought Bess,&#8221; his daughter,
by one of his mother&#8217;s maids; and now, to use his own words, he was
brought within point-blank<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxxiv" id="Page_xxxiv">[xxxiv]</a></span> of the heaviest metal of the kirk by a
similar folly. The fair transgressor, both for her fathers and her own
youth, had a large share of public sympathy. Jean Armour, for it is of
her I speak, was in her eighteenth year; with dark eyes, a handsome
foot, and a melodious tongue, she made her way to the poet&#8217;s
heart&mdash;and, as their stations in life were equal, it seemed that they
had only to be satisfied themselves to render their union easy. But
her father, in addition to being a very devout man, was a zealot of
the Old Light; and Jean, dreading his resentment, was willing, while
she loved its unforgiven satirist, to love him in secret, in the hope
that the time would come when she might safely avow it: she admitted
the poet, therefore, to her company in lonesome places, and walks
beneath the moon, where they both forgot themselves, and were at last
obliged to own a private marriage as a protection from kirk censure.
The professors of the Old Light rejoiced, since it brought a scoffing
rhymer within reach of their hand; but her father felt a twofold
sorrow, because of the shame of a favourite daughter, and for having
committed the folly with one both loose in conduct and profane of
speech. He had cause to be angry, but his anger, through his zeal,
became tyrannous: in the exercise of what he called a father&#8217;s power,
he compelled his child to renounce the poet as her husband and burn
the marriage-lines; for he regarded her marriage, without the kirk&#8217;s
permission, with a man so utterly cast away, as a worse crime than her
folly. So blind is anger! She could renounce neither her husband nor
his offspring in a lawful way, and in spite of the destruction of the
marriage lines, and renouncing the name of wife, she was as much Mrs.
Burns as marriage could make her. No one concerned seemed to think so.
Burns, who loved her tenderly, went all but mad when she renounced
him: he gave up his share of Mossgiel to his brother, and roamed,
moody and idle, about the land, with no better aim in life than a
situation in one of our western sugar-isles, and a vague hope of
distinction as a poet.</p>

<p>How the distinction which he desired as a poet was to be obtained,
was, to a poor bard in a provincial place, a sore puzzle: there were
no enterprising booksellers in the western land, and it was not to be
expected that the printers of either Kilmarnock or Paisley had money
to expend on a speculation in rhyme: it is much to the honour of his
native county that the publication which he wished for was at last
made easy. The best of his poems, in his own handwriting, had found
their way into the hands of the Ballantynes, Hamiltons, Parkers, and
Mackenzies, and were much admired. Mrs. Stewart, of Stair and Afton, a
lady of distinction and taste, had made, accidentally, the
acquaintance both of Burns and some of his songs, and was ready to
befriend him; and so favourable was the impression on all hands, that
a subscription, sufficient to defray the outlay of paper and print,
was soon filled up&mdash;one hundred copies being subscribed for by the
Parkers alone. He soon arranged materials for a volume, and put them
into the hands of a printer in Kilmarnock, the Wee Johnnie of one of
his biting epigrams. Johnnie was startled at the unceremonious freedom
of most of the pieces, and asked the poet to compose one of modest
language and moral aim, to stand at the beginning, and excuse some of
those free ones which followed: Burns, whose &#8220;Twa Dogs&#8221; was then
incomplete, finished the poem at a sitting, and put it in the van,
much to his printer&#8217;s satisfaction. If the &#8220;Jolly Beggars&#8221; was omitted
for any other cause than its freedom of sentiment and language, or
&#8220;Death and Doctor Hornbook&#8221; from any other feeling than that of being
too personal, the causes of their exclusion have remained a secret. It
is less easy to account for the emission of many songs of high merit
which he had among his papers: perhaps he thought those which he
selected were sufficient to test the taste of the public. Before he
printed the whole, he, with the consent of his brother, altered his
name from Burness to Burns, a change which, I am told, he in after
years regretted.</p>

<p>In the summer of the year 1786, the little volume, big with the hopes
and fortunes of the bard made its appearance: it was entitled simply,
&#8220;Poems, chiefly in the Scottish Dialect; by Robert Burns;&#8221; and
accompanied by a modest preface, saying, that he submitted his book to
his country with fear and with trembling, since it contained little of
the art of poesie, and at the best was but a voice given, rude, he
feared, and uncouth, to the loves, the hopes, and the fears of his own
bosom. Had a summer sun risen on a winter morning, it could not have
surprised the Lowlands of Scotland more than this Kilmarnock volume
surprised and delighted the people, one and all. The milkmaid sang his
songs, the ploughman repeated his poems; the old quoted both, and
ever<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxxv" id="Page_xxxv">[xxxv]</a></span> the devout rejoiced that idle verse had at last mixed a tone of
morality with its mirth. The volume penetrated even into Nithsdale.
&#8220;Keep it out of the way of your children,&#8221; said a Cameronian divine,
when he lent it to my father, &#8220;lest ye find them, as I found mine,
reading it on the Sabbath.&#8221; No wonder that such a volume made its way
to the hearts of a peasantry whose taste in poetry had been the marvel
of many writers: the poems were mostly on topics with which they were
familiar: the language was that of the fireside, raised above the
vulgarities of common life, by a purifying spirit of expression and
the exalting fervour of inspiration: and there was such a brilliant
and graceful mixture of the elegant and the homely, the lofty and the
low, the familiar and the elevated&mdash;such a rapid succession of scenes
which moved to tenderness or tears; or to subdued mirth or open
laughter&mdash;unlooked for allusions to scripture, or touches of sarcasm
and scandal&mdash;of superstitions to scare, and of humour to
delight&mdash;while through the whole was diffused, as the scent of flowers
through summer air, a moral meaning&mdash;a sentimental beauty, which
sweetened and sanctified all. The poet&#8217;s expectations from this little
venture were humble: he hoped as much money from it as would pay for
his passage to the West Indies, where he proposed to enter into the
service of some of the Scottish settlers, and help to manage the
double mystery of sugar-making and slavery.</p>

<p>The hearty applause which I have recorded came chiefly from the
husbandman, the shepherd, and the mechanic: the approbation of the
magnates of the west, though not less-warm, was longer in coming. Mrs.
Stewart of Stair, indeed, commended the poems and cheered their
author: Dugald Stewart received his visits with pleasure, and wondered
at his vigour of conversation as much as at his muse: the door of the
house of Hamilton was open to him, where the table was ever spread,
and the hand ever ready to help: while the purses of the Ballantynes
and the Parkers were always as open to him as were the doors of their
houses. Those persons must be regarded as the real patrons of the
poet: the high names of the district are not to be found among those
who helped him with purse and patronage in 1786, that year of deep
distress and high distinction. The Montgomerys came with their praise
when his fame was up; the Kennedys and the Boswells were silent: and
though the Cunninghams gave effectual aid, it was when the muse was
crying with a loud voice before him, &#8220;Come all and see the man whom I
delight to honour.&#8221; It would be unjust as well as ungenerous not to
mention the name of Mrs. Dunlop among the poet&#8217;s best and early
patrons: the distance at which she lived from Mossgiel had kept his
name from her till his poems appeared: but his works induced her to
desire his acquaintance, and she became his warmest and surest friend.</p>

<p>To say the truth, Burns endeavoured in every honourable way to obtain
the notice of those who had influence in the land: he copied out the
best of his unpublished poems in a fair hand, and inserting them in
his printed volume, presented it to those who seemed slow to buy: he
rewarded the notice of this one with a song&mdash;the attentions of that
one with a sally of encomiastic verse: he left psalms of his own
composing in the manse when he feasted with a divine: he enclosed
&#8220;Holy Willie&#8217;s Prayer,&#8221; with an injunction to be grave, to one who
loved mirth: he sent the &#8220;Holy Fair&#8221; to one whom he invited to drink a
gill out of a mutchkin stoup, at Mauchline market; and on accidentally
meeting with Lord Daer, he immediately commemorated the event in a
sally of verse, of a strain more free and yet as flattering as ever
flowed from the lips of a court bard. While musing over the names of
those on whom fortune had smiled, yet who had neglected to smile on
him, he remembered that he had met Miss Alexander, a young beauty of
the west, in the walks of Ballochmyle; and he recorded the impression
which this fair vision made on him in a song of unequalled elegance
and melody. He had met her in the woods in July, on the 18th of
November he sent her the song, and reminded her of the circumstance
from which it arose, in a letter which it is evident he had laboured
to render polished and complimentary. The young lady took no notice of
either the song or the poet, though willing, it is said, to hear of
both now:&mdash;this seems to have been the last attempt he made on the
taste or the sympathies of the gentry of his native district: for on
the very day following we find him busy in making arrangements for his
departure to Jamaica.</p>

<p>For this step Burns had more than sufficient reasons: the profits of
his volume amounted to little more than enough to waft him across the
Atlantic: Wee Johnnie, though the edition was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxxvi" id="Page_xxxvi">[xxxvi]</a></span> all sold, refused to
risk another on speculation: his friends, both Ballantynes and
Parkers, volunteered to relieve the printer&#8217;s anxieties, but the poet
declined their bounty, and gloomily indented himself in a ship about
to sail from Greenock, and called on his muse to take farewell of
Caledonia, in the last song he ever expected to measure in his native
land. That fine lyric, beginning &#8220;The gloomy night is gathering fast,&#8221;
was the offspring of these moments of regret and sorrow. His feelings
were not expressed in song alone: he remembered his mother and his
natural daughter, and made an assignment of all that pertained to him
at Mossgiel&mdash;and that was but little&mdash;and of all the advantage which a
cruel, unjust, and insulting law allowed in the proceeds of his poems,
for their support and behoof. This document was publicly read in the
presence of the poet, at the market-cross of Ayr, by his friend
William Chalmers, a notary public. Even this step was to Burns one of
danger: some ill-advised person had uncoupled the merciless pack of
the law at his heels, and he was obliged to shelter himself as he best
could, in woods, it is said, by day and in barns by night, till the
final hour of his departure came. That hour arrived, and his chest was
on the way to the ship, when a letter was put into his hand which
seemed to light him to brighter prospects.</p>

<p>Among the friends whom his merits had procured him was Dr. Laurie, a
district clergyman, who had taste enough to admire the deep
sensibilities as well as the humour of the poet, and the generosity to
make known both his works and his worth to the warm-hearted and
amiable Blacklock, who boldly proclaimed him a poet of the first rank,
and lamented that he was not in Edinburgh to publish another edition
of his poems. Burns was ever a man of impulse: he recalled his chest
from Greenock; he relinquished the situation he had accepted on the
estate of one Douglas; took a secret leave of his mother, and, without
an introduction to any one, and unknown personally to all, save to
Dugald Stewart, away he walked, through Glenap, to Edinburgh, full of
new hope and confiding in his genius. When he arrived, he scarcely
knew what to do: he hesitated to call on the professor; he refrained
from making himself known, as it has been supposed he did, to the
enthusiastic Blacklock; but, sitting down in an obscure lodging, he
sought out an obscure printer, recommended by a humble comrade from
Kyle, and began to negotiate for a new edition of the Poems of the
Ayrshire Ploughman. This was not the way to go about it: his barge had
well nigh been shipwrecked in the launch; and he might have lived to
regret the letter which hindered his voyage to Jamaica, had he not met
by chance in the street a gentleman of the west, of the name of
Dalzell, who introduced him to the Earl of Glencairn, a nobleman whose
classic education did not hurt his taste for Scottish poetry, and who
was not too proud to lend his helping hand to a rustic stranger of
such merit as Burns. Cunningham carried him to Creech, then the Murray
of Edinburgh, a shrewd man of business, who opened the poet&#8217;s eyes to
his true interests: the first proposals, then all but issued, were put
in the fire, and new ones printed and diffused over the island. The
subscription was headed by half the noblemen of the north: the
Caledonian Hunt, through the interest of Glencairn, took six hundred
copies: duchesses and countesses swelled the list, and such a crowding
to write down names had not been witnessed since the signing of the
solemn league and covenant.</p>

<p>While the subscription-papers were filling and the new volume printing
on a paper and in a type worthy of such high patronage, Burns remained
in Edinburgh, where, for the winter season, he was a lion, and one of
an unwonted kind. Philosophers, historians, and scholars had shaken
the elegant coteries of the city with their wit, or enlightened them
with their learning, but they were all men who had been polished by
polite letters or by intercourse with high life, and there was a
sameness in their very dress as well as address, of which peers and
peeresses had become weary. They therefore welcomed this rustic
candidate for the honour of giving wings to their hours of lassitude
and weariness, with a welcome more than common; and when his approach
was announced, the polished circle looked for the advent of a lout
from the plough, in whose uncouth manners and embarrassed address they
might find matter both for mirth and wonder. But they met with a
barbarian who was not at all barbarous: as the poet met in Lord Daer
feelings and sentiments as natural as those of a ploughman, so they
met in a ploughman manners worthy of a lord: his air was easy and
unperplexed: his address was perfectly well-bred, and elegant in its
simplicity: he felt neither eclipsed by the titled nor struck dumb
before the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxxvii" id="Page_xxxvii">[xxxvii]</a></span> learned and the eloquent, but took his station with the
ease and grace of one born to it. In the society of men alone he spoke
out: he spared neither his wit, his humour, nor his sarcasm&mdash;he seemed
to say to all&mdash;&#8220;I am a man, and you are no more; and why should I not
act and speak like one?&#8221;&mdash;it was remarked, however, that he had not
learnt, or did not desire, to conceal his emotions&mdash;that he commended
with more rapture than was courteous, and contradicted with more
bluntness than was accounted polite. It was thus with him in the
company of men: when woman approached, his look altered, his eye
beamed milder; all that was stern in his nature underwent a change,
and he received them with deference, but with a consciousness that he
could win their attention as he had won that of others, who differed,
indeed, from them only in the texture of their kirtles. This natural
power of rendering himself acceptable to women had been observed and
envied by Sillar, one of the dearest of his early comrades; and it
stood him in good stead now, when he was the object to whom the
Duchess of Gordon, the loveliest as well as the wittiest of
women&mdash;directed her discourse. Burns, she afterwards said, won the
attention of the Edinburgh ladies by a deferential way of address&mdash;by
an ease and natural grace of manners, as new as it was
unexpected&mdash;that he told them the stories of some of his tenderest
songs or liveliest poems in a style quite magical&mdash;enriching his
little narratives, which had one and all the merit of being short,
with personal incidents of humour or of pathos.</p>

<p>In a party, when Dr. Blair and Professor Walker were present, Burns
related the circumstances under which he had composed his melancholy
song, &#8220;The gloomy night is gathering fast,&#8221; in a way even more
touching than the verses: and in the company of the ruling beauties of
the time, he hesitated not to lift the veil from some of the tenderer
parts of his own history, and give them glimpses of the romance of
rustic life. A lady of birth&mdash;one of his must willing listeners&mdash;used,
I am told, to say, that she should never forget the tale which he
related of his affection for Mary Campbell, his Highland Mary, as he
loved to call her. She was fair, he said, and affectionate, and as
guileless as she was beautiful; and beautiful he thought her in a very
high degree. The first time he saw her was during one of his musing
walks in the woods of Montgomery Castle; and the first time he spoke
to her was during the merriment of a harvest-kirn. There were others
there who admired her, but he addressed her, and had the luck to win
her regard from them all. He soon found that she was the lass whom he
had long sought, but never before found&mdash;that her good looks were
surpassed by her good sense; and her good sense was equalled by her
discretion and modesty. He met her frequently: she saw by his looks
that he was sincere; she put full trust in his love, and used to
wander with him among the green knowes and stream-banks till the sun
went down and the moon rose, talking, dreaming of love and the golden
days which awaited them. He was poor, and she had only her half-year&#8217;s
fee, for she was in the condition of a servant; but thoughts of gear
never darkened their dream: they resolved to wed, and exchanged vows
of constancy and love. They plighted their vows on the Sabbath to
render them more sacred&mdash;they made them by a burn, where they had
courted, that open nature might be a witness&mdash;they made them over an
open Bible, to show that they thought of God in this mutual act&mdash;and
when they had done they both took water in their hands, and scattered
it in the air, to intimate that as the stream was pure so were their
intentions. They parted when they did this, but they parted never to
meet more: she died in a burning fever, during a visit to her
relations to prepare for her marriage; and all that he had of her was
a lock of her long bright hair, and her Bible, which she exchanged for
his.</p>

<p>Even with the tales which he related of rustic love and adventure his
own story mingled; and ladies of rank heard, for the first time, that
in all that was romantic in the passion of love, and in all that was
chivalrous in sentiment, men of distinction, both by education and
birth, were at least equalled by the peasantry of the land. They
listened with interest, and inclined their feathers beside the bard,
to hear how love went on in the west, and in no case it ran quite
smooth. Sometimes young hearts were kept asunder by the sordid
feelings of parents, who could not be persuaded to bestow their
daughter, perhaps an only one, on a wooer who could not count penny
for penny, and number cow for cow: sometimes a mother desired her
daughter to look higher than to one of her station: for her beauty and
her education entitled her to match among the lairds, rather than the
tenants; and sometimes, the devotional tastes of both father and
mother,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxxviii" id="Page_xxxviii">[xxxviii]</a></span> approving of personal looks and connexions, were averse to
see a daughter bestow her hand on one, whose language in religion was
indiscreet, and whose morals were suspected. Yet, neither the
vigilance of fathers, nor the suspicious care of aunts and mothers,
could succeed in keeping those asunder whose hearts were together; but
in these meetings circumspection and invention were necessary: all
fears were to be lulled by the seeming carelessness of the lass,&mdash;all
perils were to be met and braved by the spirit of the lad. His home,
perhaps, was at a distance, and he had wild woods to come through, and
deep streams to pass, before he could see the signal-light, now shown
and now withdrawn, at her window; he had to approach with a quick eye
and a wary foot, lest a father or a brother should see, and deter him:
he had sometimes to wish for a cloud upon the moon, whose light,
welcome to him on his way in the distance, was likely to betray him
when near; and he not unfrequently reckoned a wild night of wind and
rain as a blessing, since it helped to conceal his coming, and proved
to his mistress that he was ready to brave all for her sake. Of rivals
met and baffled; of half-willing and half-unconsenting maidens,
persuaded and won; of the light-hearted and the careless becoming
affectionate and tender; and the coy, the proud, and the satiric being
gained by &#8220;persuasive words, and more persuasive sighs,&#8221; as dames had
been gained of old, he had tales enow. The ladies listened, and smiled
at the tender narratives of the poet.</p>

<p>Of his appearance among the sons as well as the daughters of men, we
have the account of Dugald Stewart. &#8220;Burns,&#8221; says the philosopher,
&#8220;came to Edinburgh early in the winter: the attentions which he
received from all ranks and descriptions of persons, were such as
would have turned any head but his own. He retained the same
simplicity of manners and appearance which had struck me so forcibly
when I first saw him in the country: his dress was suited to his
station; plain and unpretending, with sufficient attention to
neatness: he always wore boots, and, when on more than usual ceremony,
buckskin breeches. His manners were manly, simple, and independent;
strongly expressive of conscious genius and worth, but without any
indication of forwardness, arrogance, or vanity. He took his share in
conversation, but not more than belonged to him, and listened with
apparent deference on subjects where his want of education deprived
him of the means of information. If there had been a little more of
gentleness and accommodation in his temper, he would have been still
more interesting; but he had been accustomed to give law in the circle
of his ordinary acquaintance, and his dread of anything approaching to
meanness or servility, rendered his manner somewhat decided and hard.
Nothing perhaps was more remarkable among his various attainments,
than the fluency and precision and originality of language, when he
spoke in company; more particularly as he aimed at purity in his turn
of expression, and avoided more successfully than most Scotsmen, the
peculiarities of Scottish phraseology. From his conversation I should
have pronounced him to have been fitted to excel in whatever walk of
ambition he had chosen to exert his abilities. He was passionately
fond of the beauties of nature, and I recollect he once told me, when
I was admiring a distant prospect in one of our morning walks, that
the sight of so many smoking cottages gave a pleasure to his mind,
which none could understand who had not witnessed, like himself, the
happiness and worth which cottages contained.&#8221;</p>

<p>Such was the impression which Burns made at first on the fair, the
titled, and the learned of Edinburgh; an impression which, though
lessened by intimacy and closer examination on the part of the men,
remained unimpaired, on that of the softer sex, till his dying-day.
His company, during the season of balls and festivities, continued to
be courted by all who desired to be reckoned gay or polite. Cards of
invitation fell thick on him; he was not more welcome to the plumed
and jewelled groups, whom her fascinating Grace of Gordon gathered
about her, than he was to the grave divines and polished scholars, who
assembled in the rooms of Stewart, or Blair, or Robertson. The classic
socialities of Tytler, afterwards Lord Woodhouslee, or the elaborate
supper-tables of the whimsical Monboddo, whose guests imagined they
were entertained in the manner of Lucullus or of Cicero, were not
complete without the presence of the ploughman of Kyle; and the
feelings of the rustic poet, facing such companies, though of surprise
and delight at first, gradually subsided, he said, as he discerned,
that man differed from man only in the polish, and not in the grain.
But Edinburgh offered tables and entertainers of a less orderly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxxix" id="Page_xxxix">[xxxix]</a></span> and
staid character than those I have named&mdash;where the glass circulated
with greater rapidity; where the wit flowed more freely; and where
there were neither highbred ladies to charm conversation within the
bounds of modesty, nor serious philosophers, nor grave divines, to set
a limit to the license of speech, or the hours of enjoyment. To these
companions&mdash;and these were all of the better classes, the levities of
the rustic poet&#8217;s wit and humour were as welcome us were the tenderest
of his narratives to the accomplished Duchess of Gordon and the
beautiful Miss Burnet of Monboddo; they raised a social roar not at
all classic, and demanded and provoked his sallies of wild humour, or
indecorous mirth, with as much delight as he had witnessed among the
lads of Kyle, when, at mill or forge, his humorous sallies abounded as
the ale flowed. In these enjoyments the rough, but learned William
Nicol, and the young and amiable Robert Ainslie shared: the name of
the poet was coupled with those of profane wits, free livers, and that
class of half-idle gentlemen who hang about the courts of law, or for
a season or two wear the livery of Mars, and handle cold iron.</p>

<p>Edinburgh had still another class of genteel convivialists, to whom
the poet was attracted by principles as well as by pleasure; these
were the relics of that once numerous body, the Jacobites, who still
loved to cherish the feelings of birth or education rather than of
judgment, and toasted the name of Stuart, when the last of the race
had renounced his pretensions to a throne, for the sake of peace and
the cross. Young men then, and high names were among them, annually
met on the pretender&#8217;s birth-day, and sang songs in which the white
rose of Jacobitism flourished; toasted toasts announcing adherence to
the male line of the Bruce and the Stuart, and listened to the strains
of the laureate of the day, who prophesied, in drink, the dismissal of
the intrusive Hanoverian, by the right and might of the righteous and
disinherited line. Burns, who was descended from a northern race,
whoso father was suspected of having drawn the claymore in 1745, and
who loved the blood of the Keith-Marishalls, under whose banners his
ancestors had marched, readily united himself to a band in whose
sentiments, political and social, he was a sharer. He was received
with acclamation: the dignity of laureate was conferred upon him, and
his inauguration ode, in which he recalled the names and the deeds of
the Grahams, the Erskines, the Boyds, and the Gordons, was applauded
for its fire, as well as for its sentiments. Yet, though he ate and
drank and sang with Jacobites, he was only as far as sympathy and
poesie went, of their number: his reason renounced the principles and
the religion of the Stuart line; and though he shed a tear over their
fallen fortunes&mdash;though he sympathized with the brave and honourable
names that perished in their cause&mdash;though he cursed &#8220;the butcher,
Cumberland,&#8221; and the bloody spirit which commanded the heads of the
good and the heroic to be stuck where they would affright the
passer-by, and pollute the air&mdash;he had no desire to see the splendid
fabric of constitutional freedom, which the united genius of all
parties had raised, thrown wantonly down. His Jacobitism influenced,
not his head, but his heart, and gave a mournful hue to many of his
lyric compositions.</p>

<p>Meanwhile his poems were passing through the press. Burns made a few
emendations of those published in the Kilmarnock edition, and he added
others which, as he expressed it, he had carded and spun, since he
passed Glenbuck. Some rather coarse lines were softened or omitted in
the &#8220;Twa Dogs;&#8221; others, from a change of his personal feelings, were
made in the &#8220;Vision:&#8221; &#8220;Death and Doctor Hornbook,&#8221; excluded before,
was admitted now: the &#8220;Dream&#8221; was retained, in spite of the
remonstrances of Mrs. Stewart, of Stair, and Mrs. Dunlop; and the
&#8220;Brigs of Ayr,&#8221; in compliment to his patrons in his native district,
and the &#8220;Address to Edinburgh,&#8221; in honour of his titled and
distinguished friends in that metropolis, were printed for the first
time. He was unwilling to alter what he had once printed: his friends,
classic, titled, and rustic, found him stubborn and unpliable, in
matters of criticism; yet he was generally of a complimental mood: he
loaded the robe of Coila in the &#8220;Vision,&#8221; with more scenes than it
could well contain, that he might include in the landscape, all the
country-seats of his friends, and he gave more than their share of
commendation to the Wallaces, out of respect to his friend Mrs.
Dunlop. Of the critics of Edinburgh he said, they spun the thread of
their criticisms so fine that it was unfit for either warp or weft;
and of its scholars, he said, they were never satisfied with any
Scottish poet, unless they could trace him in Horace. One morning at
Dr. Blair&#8217;s breakfast-table, when the &#8220;Holy Fair&#8221; was the subject of
conversation, the reverend critic said, &#8220;Why should<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xl" id="Page_xl">[xl]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8216;&mdash;&mdash;Moody speel the holy door<br /></span>
<span class="i4">With tidings of <i>salvation</i>?&#8217;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>if you had said, with tidings of <i>damnation</i>, the satire would have
been the better and the bitterer.&#8221; &#8220;Excellent!&#8221; exclaimed the poet,
&#8220;the alteration is capital, and I hope you will honour me by allowing
me to say in a note at whose suggestion it was made.&#8221; Professor
Walker, who tells the anecdote, adds that Blair evaded, with equal
good humour and decision, this not very polite request; nor was this
the only slip which the poet made on this occasion: some one asked him
in which of the churches of Edinburgh he had received the highest
gratification: he named the High-church, but gave the preference over
all preachers to Robert Walker, the colleague and rival in eloquence
of Dr. Blair himself, and that in a tone so pointed and decisive as to
make all at the table stare and look embarrassed. The poet confessed
afterwards that he never reflected on his blunder without pain and
mortification. Blair probably had this in his mind, when, on reading
the poem beginning &#8220;When Guildford good our pilot stood,&#8221; he
exclaimed, &#8220;Ah! the politics of Burns always smell of the smithy,&#8221;
meaning, that they were vulgar and common.</p>

<p>In April, the second or Edinburgh, edition was published: it was
widely purchased, and as warmly commended. The country had been
prepared for it by the generous and discriminating criticisms of Henry
Mackenzie, published in that popular periodical, &#8220;The Lounger,&#8221; where
he says, &#8220;Burns possesses the spirit as well as the fancy of a poet;
that honest pride and independence of soul, which are sometimes the
muse&#8217;s only dower, break forth on every occasion, in his works.&#8221; The
praise of the author of the &#8220;Man of Feeling&#8221; was not more felt by
Burns, than it was by the whole island: the harp of the north had not
been swept for centuries by a hand so forcible, and at the same time
so varied, that it awakened every tone, whether of joy or woe: the
language was that of rustic life; the scenes of the poems were the
dusty barn, the clay-floored reeky cottage, and the furrowed field;
and the characters were cowherds, ploughmen, and mechanics. The volume
was embellished by a head of the poet from the hand of the now
venerable Alexander Nasmith; and introduced by a dedication to the
noblemen and gentlemen of the Caledonian Hunt, in a style of vehement
independence, unknown hitherto in the history of subscriptions. The
whole work, verse, prose, and portrait, won public attention, and kept
it: and though some critics signified their displeasure at expressions
which bordered on profanity, and at a license of language which they
pronounced impure, by far the greater number united their praise to
the all but general voice; nay, some scrupled not to call him, from
his perfect ease and nature and variety, the Scottish Shakspeare. No
one rejoiced more in his success and his fame, than the matron of
Mossgiel.</p>

<p>Other matters than his poems and socialities claimed the attention of
Burns in Edinburgh. He had a hearty relish for the joyous genius of
Allan Ramsay; he traced out his residences, and rejoiced to think that
while he stood in the shop of his own bookseller, Creech, the same
floor had been trod by the feet of his great forerunner. He visited,
too, the lowly grave of the unfortunate Robert Fergusson; and it must
be recorded to the shame of the magistrates of Edinburgh, that they
allowed him to erect a headstone to his memory, and to the scandal of
Scotland, that in such a memorial he had not been anticipated. He
seems not to have regarded the graves of scholars or philosophers; and
he trod the pavements where the warlike princes and nobles had walked
without any emotion. He loved, however, to see places celebrated in
Scottish song, and fields where battles for the independence of his
country had been stricken; and, with money in his pocket which his
poems had produced, and with a letter from a witty but weak man, Lord
Buchan, instructing him to pull birks on the Yarrow, broom on the
Cowden-knowes, and not to neglect to admire the ruins of Drybrugh
Abbey, Burns set out on a border tour, accompanied by Robert Ainslie,
of Berrywell. As the poet had talked of returning to the plough, Dr.
Blair imagined that he was on his way back to the furrowed field, and
wrote him a handsome farewell, saying he was leaving Edinburgh with a
character which had survived many temptations; with a name which would
be placed with the Ramsays and the Fergussons, and with the hopes of
all, that, in a second volume, on which his fate as a poet would very
much depend, he might rise yet higher in merit and in fame. Burns, who

gone, is said to have muttered, &#8220;Ay, but a man&#8217;s first book is
sometimes like his first babe, healthier and stronger than those which
follow.&#8221;</p>

<p>On the 6th of May, 1787, Burns reached Berrywell: he recorded of the
laird, that he was clear-headed, and of Miss Ainslie, that she was
amiable and handsome&mdash;of Dudgeon, the author of &#8220;The Maid that tends
the Goats,&#8221; that he had penetration and modesty, and of the preacher,
Bowmaker, that he was a man of strong lungs and vigorous remark. On
crossing the Tweed at Coldstream he took off his hat, and kneeling
down, repeated aloud the two last verses of the &#8220;Cotter&#8217;s Saturday
Night:&#8221; on returning, he drunk tea with Brydone, the traveller, a man,
he said, kind and benevolent: he cursed one Cole as an English
Hottentot, for having rooted out an ancient garden belonging to a
Romish ruin; and he wrote of Macdowal, of Caverton-mill, that by his
skill in rearing sheep, he sold his flocks, ewe and lamb, for a couple
of guineas each: that he washed his sheep before shearing&mdash;and by his
turnips improved sheep-husbandry; he added, that lands were generally
let at sixteen shillings the Scottish acre; the farmers rich, and,
compared to Ayrshire, their houses magnificent. On his way to Jedburgh
he visited an old gentleman in whose house was an arm-chair, once the
property of the author of &#8220;The Seasons;&#8221; he reverently examined the
relic, and could scarcely be persuaded to sit in it: he was a warm
admirer of Thomson.</p>

<p>In Jedburgh, Burns found much to interest him: the ruins of a splendid
cathedral, and of a strong castle&mdash;and, what was still more
attractive, an amiable young lady, very handsome, with &#8220;beautiful
hazel eyes, full of spirit, sparkling with delicious moisture,&#8221; and
looks which betokened a high order of female mind. He gave her his
portrait, and entered this remembrance of her attractions among his
memoranda:&mdash;&#8220;My heart is thawed into melting pleasure, after being so
long frozen up in the Greenland bay of indifference, amid the noise
and nonsense of Edinburgh. I am afraid my bosom has nearly as much
tinder as ever. Jed, pure be thy streams, and hallowed thy sylvan
banks: sweet Isabella Lindsay, may peace dwell in thy bosom
uninterrupted, except by the tumultuous throbbings of rapturous love!&#8221;
With the freedom of Jedburgh, handsomely bestowed by the magistrates,
in his pocket, Burns made his way to Wauchope, the residence of Mrs.
Scott, who had welcomed him into the world as a poet in verses lively
and graceful: he found her, he said, &#8220;a lady of sense and taste, and
of a decision peculiar to female authors.&#8221; After dining with Sir
Alexander Don, who, he said, was a clever man, but far from a match
for his divine lady, a sister of his patron Glencairn, he spent an
hour among the beautiful ruins of Dryburgh Abbey; glanced on the
splendid remains of Melrose; passed, unconscious of the future, over
that ground on which have arisen the romantic towers of Abbotsford;
dined with certain of the Souters of Selkirk; and visited the old keep
of Thomas the Rhymer, and a dozen of the hills and streams celebrated
in song. Nor did he fail to pay his respects, after returning through
Dunse, to Sir James Hall, of Dunglass, and his lady, and was much
pleased with the scenery of their romantic place. He was now joined by
a gentleman of the name of Kerr, and crossing the Tweed a second time,
penetrated into England, as far as the ancient town of Newcastle,
where he smiled at a facetious Northumbrian, who at dinner caused the
beef to be eaten before the broth was served, in obedience to an
ancient injunction, lest the hungry Scotch should come and snatch it.
On his way back he saw, what proved to be prophetic of his own
fortune&mdash;the roup of an unfortunate farmer&#8217;s stock: he took out his
journal, and wrote with a troubled brow, &#8220;Rigid economy, and decent
industry, do you preserve me from being the principal <i>dramatis
person&aelig;</i>, in such a scene of horror.&#8221; He extended his tour to
Carlisle, and from thence to the banks of the Nith, where he looked at
the farm of Ellisland, with the intention of trying once more his
fortune at the plough, should poetry and patronage fail him.</p>

<p>On his way through the West, Burns spent a few days with his mother at
Mossgiel: he had left her an unknown and an almost banished man: he
returned in fame and in sunshine, admired by all who aspired to be
thought tasteful or refined. He felt offended alike with the patrician
stateliness of Edinburgh and the plebeian servility of the husbandmen
of Ayrshire; and dreading the influence of the unlucky star which had
hitherto ruled his lot, he bought a pocket Milton, he said, for the
purpose of studying the intrepid independence and daring magnanimity,
and noble defiance of hardships, exhibited by Satan! In this mood he
reached Edinburgh&mdash;only to leave it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xlii" id="Page_xlii">[xlii]</a></span> again on three hurried excursions
into the Highlands. The route which he took and the sentiments which
the scenes awakened, are but faintly intimated in the memoranda which
he made. His first journey seems to have been performed in ill-humour;
at Stirling, his Jacobitism, provoked at seeing the ruined palace of
the Stuarts, broke out in some unloyal lines which he had the
indiscretion to write with a diamond on the window of a public inn. At
Carron, where he was refused a sight of the magnificent foundry, he
avenged himself in epigram. At Inverary he resented some real or
imaginary neglect on the part of his Grace of Argyll, by a stinging
lampoon; nor can he be said to have fairly regained his serenity of
temper, till he danced his wrath away with some Highland ladies at
Dumbarton.</p>

<p>His second excursion was made in the company of Dr. Adair, of
Harrowgate: the reluctant doors of Carron foundry were opened to him,
and he expressed his wonder at the blazing furnaces and broiling
labours of the place; he removed the disloyal lines from the window of
the inn at Stirling, and he paid a two days&#8217; visit to Ramsay of
Ochtertyre, a distinguished scholar, and discussed with him future
topics for the muse. &#8220;I have been in the company of many men of
genius,&#8221; said Ramsay afterwards to Currie, &#8220;some of them poets, but
never witnessed such flashes of intellectual brightness as from
him&mdash;the impulse of the moment, sparks of celestial fire.&#8221; From the
Forth he went to the Devon, in the county of Clackmannan, where, for
the first time, he saw the beautiful Charlotte Hamilton, the sister of
his friend Gavin Hamilton, of Mauchline. &#8220;She is not only beautiful,&#8221;
he thus writes to her brother, &#8220;but lovely: her form is elegant, her
features not regular, but they have the smile of sweetness, and the
settled complacency of good nature in the highest degree. Her eyes are
fascinating; at once expressive of good sense, tenderness and a noble
mind. After the exercise of our riding to the Falls, Charlotte was
exactly Dr. Donne&#8217;s mistress:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i8">&#8220;Her pure and eloquent blood<br />
</span>
<span class="i0">Spoke in her cheeks, and so distinctly wrought,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That one would almost say her body thought.&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Accompanied by this charming dame, he visited an old lady, Mrs. Bruce,
of Clackmannan, who, in the belief that she had the blood of the royal
Bruce in her veins, received the poet with something of princely
state, and, half in jest, conferred the honour of knighthood upon him,
with her ancestor&#8217;s sword, saying, in true Jacobitical mood, that she
had a better right to do that than some folk had! In the same pleasing
company he visited the famous cataract on the Devon, called the
Cauldron Lian, and the Rumbling bridge, a single arch thrown, it is
said by the devil, over the Devon, at the height of a hundred feet in
the air. It was the complaint of his companions that Burns exhibited
no raptures, and poured out no unpremeditated verses at such
magnificent scenes. But he did not like to be tutored or prompted:
&#8220;Look, look!&#8221; exclaimed some one, as Carron foundry belched forth
flames&mdash;&#8220;look, Burns, look! good heavens, what a grand sight!&mdash;look!&#8221;
&#8220;I would not look&mdash;look, sir, at your bidding,&#8221; said the bard, turning
away, &#8220;were it into the mouth of hell!&#8221; When he visited, at a future
time, the romantic Linn of Creehope, in Nithsdale, he looked silently
at its wonders, and showed none of the hoped-for rapture. &#8220;You do not
admire it, I fear,&#8221; said a gentleman who accompanied him; &#8220;I could not
admire it more, sir,&#8221; replied Burns, &#8220;if He who made it were to desire
me to do it.&#8221; There are other reasons for the silence of Burns amid
the scenes of the Devon: he was charmed into love by the sense and the
beauty of Charlotte Hamilton, and rendered her homage in that sweet
song, &#8220;The Banks of the Devon,&#8221; and in a dozen letters written with
more than his usual care, elegance, and tenderness. But the lady was
neither to be won by verse nor by prose: she afterwards gave her hand
to Adair, the poet&#8217;s companion, and, what was less meritorious, threw
his letters into the fire.</p>

<p>The third and last tour into the North was in company of Nicol of the
High-School of Edinburgh: on the fields of Bannockburn and
Falkirk&mdash;places of triumph and of woe to Scotland, he gave way to
patriotic impulses, and in these words he recorded them:&mdash;&#8220;Stirling,
August 20, 1787: this morning I knelt at the tomb of Sir John the
Graham, the gallant friend of the immortal Wallace; and two hours ago
I said a fervent prayer for old Caledonia, over the hole in a
whin<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xliii" id="Page_xliii">[xliii]</a></span>stone where Robert the Bruce fixed his royal standard on the
banks of Bannockburn.&#8221; He then proceeded northward by Ochtertyre, the
water of Earn, the vale of Glen Almond, and the traditionary grave of
Ossian. He looked in at princely Taymouth; mused an hour or two among
the Birks of Aberfeldy; gazed from Birnam top; paused amid the wild
grandeur of the pass of Killiecrankie, at the stone which marks the
spot where a second patriot Graham fell, and spent a day at Blair,
where he experienced the graceful kindness of the Duke of Athol, and in a strain truly elegant, petitioned him, in the name of Bruar Water, to hide the utter nakedness of its
otherwise picturesque banks, with plantations of birch and oak.
Quitting Blair he followed the course of the Spey, and passing, as he
told his brother, through a wild country, among cliffs gray with
eternal snows, and glens gloomy and savage, reached Findhorn in mist
and darkness; visited Castle Cawdor, where Macbeth murdered Duncan;
hastened through Inverness to Urquhart Castle, and the Falls of Fyers,
and turned southward to Kilravock, over the fatal moor of Culloden. He
admired the ladies of that classic region for their snooded ringlets,
simple elegance of dress, and expressive eyes: in Mrs. Rose, of
Kilravock Castle, he found that matronly grace and dignity which he
owned he loved; and in the Duke and Duchess of Gordon a renewal of
that more than kindness with which they had welcomed him in Edinburgh.
But while he admired the palace of Fochabers, and was charmed by the
condescensions of the noble proprietors, he forgot that he had left a
companion at the inn, too proud and captious to be pleased at favours
showered on others: he hastened back to the inn with an invitation and
an apology: he found the fiery pedant in a foaming rage, striding up
and down the street, cursing in Scotch and Latin the loitering
postilions for not yoking the horses, and hurrying him away. All
apology and explanation was in vain, and Burns, with a vexation which
he sought not to conceal, took his seat silently beside the irascible
pedagogue, and returned to the South by Broughty Castle, the banks of
Endermay and Queensferry. He parted with the Highlands in a kindly
mood, and loved to recal the scenes and the people, both in
conversation and in song.</p>

<p>On his return to Edinburgh he had to bide the time of his bookseller
and the public: the impression of his poems, extending to two thousand
eight hundred copies, was sold widely: much of the money had to come
from a distance, and Burns lingered about the northern metropolis,
expecting a settlement with Creech, and with the hope that those who
dispensed his country&#8217;s patronage might remember one who then, as now,
was reckoned an ornament to the land. But Creech, a parsimonious man,
was slow in his payments; the patronage of the country was swallowed
up in the sink of politics, and though noblemen smiled, and ladies of
rank nodded their jewelled heads in approbation of every new song he
sung and every witty sally he uttered, they reckoned any further
notice or care superfluous: the poet, an observant man, saw all this;
but hope was the cordial of his heart, he said, and he hoped and
lingered on. Too active a genius to remain idle, he addressed himself
to the twofold business of love and verse. Repulsed by the stately
Beauty of the Devon, he sought consolation in the society of one, as
fair, and infinitely more witty; and as an accident had for a time
deprived him of the use of one of his legs, he gave wings to hours of
pain, by writing a series of letters to this Edinburgh enchantress, in
which he signed himself Sylvander, and addressed her under the name of
Clarinda. In these compositions, which no one can regard as serious,
and which James Grahame the poet called &#8220;a romance of real Platonic
affection,&#8221; amid much affectation both of language and sentiment, and
a desire to say fine and startling things, we can see the proud heart
of the poet throbbing in the dread of being neglected or forgotten by
his country. The love which he offers up at the altar of wit and
beauty, seems assumed and put on, for its rapture is artificial, and
its brilliancy that of an icicle: no woman was ever wooed and won in
that Malvolio way; and there is no doubt that Mrs. M&#8217;Lehose felt as
much offence as pleasure at this boisterous display of regard. In
aftertimes he loved to remember her:&mdash;when wine circulated, Mrs. Mac
was his favourite toast.</p>

<p>During this season he began his lyric contributions to the Musical
Museum of Johnson, a work which, amid many imperfections of taste and
arrangement, contains more of the true old music and genuine old songs
of Scotland, than any other collection with which I am acquainted.
Burns gathered oral airs, and fitted them with words of mirth or of
woe, of tenderness or of humour, with unexampled readiness and
felicity; he eked out old fragments and sobered down licentious<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xliv" id="Page_xliv">[xliv]</a></span>
strains so much in the olden spirit and feeling, that the new cannot
be distinguished from the ancient; nay, he inserted lines and half
lines, with such skill and nicety, that antiquarians are perplexed to
settle which is genuine or which is simulated. Yet with all this he
abated not of the natural mirth or the racy humour of the lyric muse
of Scotland: he did not like her the less because she walked like some
of the maidens of her strains, high-kilted at times, and spoke with
the freedom of innocence. In these communications we observe how
little his border-jaunt among the fountains of ancient song
contributed either of sentiment or allusion, to his lyrics; and how
deeply his strains, whether of pity or of merriment, were coloured by
what he had seen, and heard, and felt in the Highlands. In truth, all
that lay beyond the Forth was an undiscovered land to him; while the
lowland districts were not only familiar to his mind and eye, but all
their more romantic vales and hills and streams were already musical
in songs of such excellence as induced him to dread failure rather
than hope triumph. Moreover, the Highlands teemed with jacobitical
feelings, and scenes hallowed by the blood or the sufferings of men
heroic, and perhaps misguided; and the poet, willingly yielding to an
impulse which was truly romantic, and believed by thousands to be
loyal, penned his songs on Drumossie, and Killiecrankie, as the
spirit of sorrow or of bitterness prevailed. Though accompanied,
during his northern excursions, by friends whose socialities and
conversation forbade deep thought, or even serious remark, it will be
seen by those who read his lyrics with care, that his wreath is
indebted for some of its fairest flowers to the Highlands.</p>

<p>The second winter of the poet&#8217;s abode in Edinburgh had now arrived: it
opened, as might have been expected, with less rapturous welcomes and
with more of frosty civility than the first. It must be confessed,
that indulgence in prolonged socialities, and in company which, though
clever, could not be called select, contributed to this; nor must it
be forgotten that his love for the sweeter part of creation was now
and then carried beyond the limits of poetic respect, and the
delicacies of courtesy; tending to estrange the austere and to lessen
the admiration at first common to all. Other causes may be assigned
for this wane of popularity: he took no care to conceal his contempt
for all who depended on mere scholarship for eminence, and he had a
perilous knack in sketching with a sarcastic hand the characters of
the learned and the grave. Some indeed of the high literati of the
north&mdash;Home, the author of Douglas, was one of them&mdash;spoke of the poet
as a chance or an accident: and though they admitted that he was a
poet, yet he was not one of settled grandeur of soul, brightened by
study. Burns was probably aware of this; he takes occasion in some of
his letters to suggest, that the hour may be at hand when he shall be
accounted by scholars as a meteor, rather than a fixed light, and to
suspect that the praise bestowed on his genius was partly owing to the
humility of his condition. From his lingering so long about Edinburgh,
the nobility began to dread a second volume by subscription, the
learned to regard him as a fierce Theban, who resolved to carry all
the outworks to the temple of Fame without the labour of making
regular approaches; while a third party, and not the least numerous,
looked on him with distrust, as one who hovered between Jacobite and
Jacobin; who disliked the loyal-minded, and loved to lampoon the
reigning family. Besides, the marvel of the inspired ploughman had
begun to subside; the bright gloss of novelty was worn off, and his
fault lay in his unwillingness to see that he had made all the sport
which the Philistines expected, and was required to make room for some
&#8220;salvage&#8221; of the season, to paw, and roar, and shake the mane. The
doors of the titled, which at first opened spontaneous, like those in
Milton&#8217;s heaven, were now unclosed for him with a tardy courtesy: he
was received with measured stateliness, and seldom requested to repeat
his visit. Of this changed aspect of things he complained to a friend:
but his real sorrows were mixed with those of the fancy:&mdash;he told Mrs.
Dunlop with what pangs of heart he was compelled to take shelter in a
corner, lest the rattling equipage of some gaping blockhead should
mangle him in the mire. In this land of titles and wealth such
querulous sensibilities must have been frequently offended.</p>

<p>Burns, who had talked lightly hitherto of resuming the plough, began
now to think seriously about it, for he saw it must come to that at
last. Miller, of Dalswinton, a gentleman of scientific acquirements,
and who has the merit of applying the impulse of steam to navigation,
had offered the poet the choice of his farms, on a fair estate which
he had purchased on the Nith: aided by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xlv" id="Page_xlv">[xlv]</a></span> a westland farmer, he selected
Ellisland, a beautiful spot, fit alike for the steps of ploughman or
poet. On intimating this to the magnates of Edinburgh, no one lamented
that a genius so bright and original should be driven to win his bread
with the sweat of his brow: no one, with an indignant eye, ventured to
tell those to whom the patronage of this magnificent empire was
confided, that they were misusing the sacred trust, and that posterity
would curse them for their coldness or neglect: neither did any of the
rich nobles, whose tables he had adorned by his wit, offer to enable
him to toil free of rent, in a land of which he was to be a permanent
ornament;&mdash;all were silent&mdash;all were cold&mdash;the Earl of Glencairn
alone, aided by Alexander Wood, a gentleman who merits praise oftener
than he is named, did the little that was done or attempted to be done
for him: nor was that little done on the peer&#8217;s part without
solicitation:&mdash;&#8220;I wish to go into the excise;&#8221; thus he wrote to
Glencairn; &#8220;and I am told your lordship&#8217;s interest will easily procure
me the grant from the commissioners: and your lordship&#8217;s patronage and
goodness, which have already rescued me from obscurity, wretchedness,
and exile, emboldens me to ask that interest. You have likewise put it
in my power to save the little tie of home that sheltered an aged
mother, two brothers, and three sisters from destruction. I am ill
qualified to dog the heels of greatness with the impertinence of
solicitation, and tremble nearly as much at the thought of the cold
promise as the cold denial.&#8221; The farm and the excise exhibit the
poet&#8217;s humble scheme of life: the money of the one, he thought, would
support the toil of the other, and in the fortunate management of
both, he looked for the rough abundance, if not the elegancies
suitable to a poet&#8217;s condition.</p>

<p>While Scotland was disgraced by sordidly allowing her brightest genius
to descend to the plough and the excise, the poet hastened his
departure from a city which had witnessed both his triumph and his
shame: he bade farewell in a few well-chosen words to such of the
classic literati&mdash;the Blairs, the Stewarts, the Mackenzies, and the
Tytlers&mdash;as had welcomed the rustic bard and continued to countenance
him; while in softer accents he bade adieu to the Clarindas and
Chlorises of whose charms he had sung, and, having wrung a settlement
from Creech, he turned his steps towards Mossgiel and Mauchline. He
had several reasons, and all serious ones, for taking Ayrshire in his
way to the Nith: he desired to see his mother, his brothers and
sisters, who had partaken of his success, and were now raised from
pining penury to comparative affluence: he desired to see those who
had aided him in his early struggles into the upper air&mdash;perhaps
those, too, who had looked coldly on, and smiled at his outward
aspirations after fame or distinction; but more than all, he desired
to see one whom he once and still dearly loved, who had been a
sufferer for his sake, and whom he proposed to make mistress of his
fireside and the sharer of his fortunes. Even while whispering of love
to Charlotte Hamilton, on the banks of the Devon, or sighing out the
affected sentimentalities of platonic or pastoral love in the ear of
Clarinda, his thoughts wandered to her whom he had left bleaching her
webs among the daisies on Mauchline braes&mdash;she had still his heart,
and in spite of her own and her father&#8217;s disclamation, she was his
wife. It was one of the delusions of this great poet, as well as of
those good people, the Armours, that the marriage had been dissolved
by the destruction of the marriage-lines, and that Robert Burns and
Jean Armour were as single as though they had neither vowed nor
written themselves man and wife. Be that as it may, the time was come
when all scruples and obstacles were to be removed which stood in the
way of their union: their hands were united by Gavin Hamilton,
according to law, in April, 1788: and even the Reverend Mr. Auld, so
mercilessly lampooned, smiled forgivingly as the poet satisfied a
church wisely scrupulous regarding the sacred ceremony of marriage.</p>

<p>Though Jean Armour was but a country lass of humble degree, she had
sense and intelligence, and personal charms sufficient not only to win
and fix the attentions of the poet, but to sanction the praise which
he showered on her in song. In a letter to Mrs. Dunlop, he thus
describes her: &#8220;The most placid good nature and sweetness of
disposition, a warm heart, gratefully devoted with all its powers to
love me; vigorous health and sprightly cheerfulness, set off to the
best advantage by a more than commonly handsome figure: these I think
in a woman may make a good wife, though she should never have read a
page but the Scriptures, nor have danced in a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xlvi" id="Page_xlvi">[xlvi]</a></span> brighter assembly than
a penny-pay wedding.&#8221; To the accomplished Margaret Chalmers, of
Edinburgh, he adds, to complete the picture, &#8220;I have got the
handsomest figure, the sweetest temper, the soundest constitution, and
kindest heart in the country: a certain late publication of Scots&#8217;
poems she has perused very devoutly, and all the ballads in the land,
as she has the finest wood-note wild you ever heard.&#8221; With his young
wife, a punch bowl of Scottish marble, and an eight-day clock, both
presents from Mr. Armour, now reconciled to his eminent son-in-law,
with a new plough, and a beautiful heifer, given by Mrs. Dunlop, with
about four hundred pounds in his pocket, a resolution to toil, and a
hope of success, Burns made his appearance on the banks of the Nith,
and set up his staff at Ellisland. This farm, now a classic spot, is
about six miles up the river from Dumfries; it extends to upwards of a
hundred acres: the soil is kindly; the holmland portion of it loamy
and rich, and it has at command fine walks on the river side, and
views of the Friar&#8217;s Carse, Cowehill, and Dalswinton. For a while the
poet had to hide his head in a smoky hovel; till a house to his fancy,
and offices for his cattle and his crops were built, his accommodation
was sufficiently humble; and his mind taking its hue from his
situation, infused a bitterness into the letters in which he first
made known to his western friends that he had fixed his abode in
Nithsdale. &#8220;I am here,&#8221; said he, &#8220;at the very elbow of existence: the
only things to be found in perfection in this country are stupidity
and canting; prose they only know in graces and prayers, and the value
of these they estimate as they do their plaiden-webs, by the ell: as
for the muses, they have as much an idea of a rhinoceros as of a
poet.&#8221; &#8220;This is an undiscovered clime,&#8221; he at another period exclaims,
&#8220;it is unknown to poetry, and prose never looked on it save in drink.
I sit by the fire, and listen to the hum of the spinning-wheel: I
hear, but cannot see it, for it is hidden in the smoke which eddies
round and round me before it seeks to escape by window and door. I
have no converse but with the ignorance which encloses me: No kenned
face but that of my old mare, Jenny Geddes&mdash;my life is dwindled down
to mere existence.&#8221;</p>

<p>When the poet&#8217;s new house was built and plenished, and the atmosphere
of his mind began to clear, he found the land to be fruitful, and its
people intelligent and wise. In Riddel, of Friar&#8217;s Carse, he found a
scholar and antiquarian; in Miller, of Dalswinton, a man conversant
with science as well as with the world; in M&#8217;Murdo, of Drumlanrig, a
generous and accomplished gentleman; and in John Syme, of Ryedale, a
man much after his own heart, and a lover of the wit and socialities
of polished life. Of these gentlemen Riddel, who was his neighbour,
was the favourite: a door was made in the march-fence which separated
Ellisland from Friar&#8217;s Carse, that the poet might indulge in the
retirement of the Carse hermitage, a little lodge in the wood, as
romantic as it was beautiful, while a pathway was cut through the
dwarf oaks and birches which fringed the river bank, to enable the
poet to saunter and muse without lot or interruption. This attention
was rewarded by an inscription for the hermitage, written with
elegance as well as feeling, and which was the first fruits of his
fancy in this unpoetic land. In a happier strain he remembered Matthew
Henderson: this is one of the sweetest as well as happiest of his
poetic compositions. He heard of his friend&#8217;s death, and called on
nature animate and inanimate, to lament the loss of one who held the
patent of his honours from God alone, and who loved all that was pure
and lovely and good. &#8220;The Whistle&#8221; is another of his Ellisland
compositions: the contest which he has recorded with such spirit and
humour took place almost at his door: the heroes were Fergusson, of
Craigdarroch, Sir Robert Laurie, of Maxwelltown, and Riddel, of the
Friar&#8217;s Carse: the poet was present, and drank bottle and bottle about
with the best, and when all was done he seemed much disposed, as an
old servant at Friar&#8217;s Carse remembered, to take up the victor.</p>

<p>Burns had become fully reconciled to Nithsdale, and was on the most
intimate terms with the muse when he produced Tam O&#8217; Shanter, the
crowning glory of all his poems. For this marvellous tale we are
indebted to something like accident: Francis Grose, the antiquary,
happened to visit Friar&#8217;s Carse, and as he loved wine and wit, the
total want of imagination was no hinderance to his friendly
intercourse with the poet: &#8220;Alloway&#8217;s auld haunted kirk&#8221; was
mentioned, and Grose said he would include it in his illustrations of
the antiquities of Scotland, if the bard of the Doon would write a
poem to accompany it. Burns consented, and before he left the table,
the various traditions which belonged to the ruin were passing through
his mind. One of these was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xlvii" id="Page_xlvii">[xlvii]</a></span> of a farmer, who, on a night wild with
wind and rain, on passing the old kirk was startled by a light
glimmering inside the walls; on drawing near he saw a caldron hung
over a fire, in which the heads and limbs of children were simmering:
there was neither witch nor fiend to guard it, so he unhooked the
caldron, turned out the contents, and carried it home as a trophy. A
second tradition was of a man of Kyle, who, having been on a market
night detained late in Ayr, on crossing the old bridge of Doon, on his
way home, saw a light streaming through the gothic window of Alloway
kirk, and on riding near, beheld a batch of the district witches
dancing merrily round their master, the devil, who kept them &#8220;louping
and flinging&#8221; to the sound of a bagpipe. He knew several of the old
crones, and smiled at their gambols, for they were dancing in their
smocks: but one of them, and she happened to be young and rosy, had on
a smock shorter than those of her companions by two spans at least,
which so moved the farmer that he exclaimed, &#8220;Weel luppan, Maggie wi&#8217;
the short sark!&#8221; Satan stopped his music, the light was extinguished,
and out rushed the hags after the farmer, who made at the gallop for
the bridge of Doon, knowing that they could not cross a stream: he
escaped; but Maggie, who was foremost, seized his horse&#8217;s tail at the
middle of the bridge, and pulled it off in her efforts to stay him.</p>

<p>This poem was the work of a single day: Burns walked out to his
favourite musing path, which runs towards the old tower of the Isle,
along Nithside, and was observed to walk hastily and mutter as he
went. His wife knew by these signs that he was engaged in composition,
and watched him from the window; at last wearying, and moreover
wondering at the unusual length of his meditations, she took her
children with her and went to meet him; but as he seemed not to see
her, she stept aside among the broom to allow him to pass, which he
did with a flushed brow and dropping eyes, reciting these lines
aloud:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;Now Tam! O, Tum! had thae been queans,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A&#8217; plump and strapping in their teens,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their sacks, instead o&#8217; creeshie flannen,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">I wad hae gien them off my hurdies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For ae blink o&#8217; the bonnie burdies!&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>He embellished this wild tradition from fact as well as from fancy:
along the road which Tam came on that eventful night his memory
supplied circumstances which prepared him for the strange sight at the
kirk of Alloway. A poor chapman had perished, some winters before, in
the snow; a murdered child had been found by some early hunters; a
tippling farmer had fallen from his horse at the expense of his neck,
beside a &#8220;meikle stane&#8221;; and a melancholy old woman had hanged herself
at the bush aboon the well, as the poem relates: all these matters the
poet pressed into the service of the muse, and used them with a skill
which adorns rather than oppresses the legend. A pert lawyer from
Dumfries objected to the language as obscure: &#8220;Obscure, sir!&#8221; said
Burns; &#8220;you know not the language of that great master of your own
art&mdash;the devil. If you had a witch for your client you would not be
able to manage her defence!&#8221;</p>

<p>He wrote few poems after his marriage, but he composed many songs: the
sweet voice of Mrs. Burns and the craving of Johnson&#8217;s Museum will in
some measure account for the number, but not for their variety, which
is truly wonderful. In the history of that mournful strain, &#8220;Mary in
Heaven,&#8221; we read the story of many of his lyrics, for they generally
sprang from his personal feelings: no poet has put more of himself
into his poetry than Burns, &#8220;Robert, though ill of a cold,&#8221; said his
wife, &#8220;had been busy all day&mdash;a day of September, 1789, with the
shearers in the field, and as he had got most of the corn into the
stack-yard, was in good spirits; but when twilight came he grew sad
about something, and could not rest: he wandered first up the
waterside, and then went into the stack-yard: I followed, and begged
him to come into the house, as he was ill, and the air was sharp and
cold. He said, &#8216;Ay, ay,&#8217; but did not come: he threw himself down on
some loose sheaves, and lay looking at the sky, and particularly at a
large, bright star, which shone like another moon. At last, but that
was long after I had left him, he came home&mdash;the song was already
composed.&#8221; To the memory of Mary Campbell he dedicated<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xlviii" id="Page_xlviii">[xlviii]</a></span> that touching
ode; and he thus intimates the continuance of his early affection for
&#8220;The fair haired lass of the west,&#8221; in a letter of that time to Mrs.
Dunlop. &#8220;If there is another life, it must be only for the just, the
benevolent, the amiable, and the humane. What a flattering idea, then,
is a world to come! There shall I, with speechless agony of rapture,
again recognise my lost, my ever dear Mary, whose bosom was fraught
with truth, honour, constancy, and love.&#8221; These melancholy words gave
way in their turn to others of a nature lively and humorous: &#8220;Tam
Glen,&#8221; in which the thoughts flow as freely as the waters of the Nith,
on whose banks he wrote it; &#8220;Findlay,&#8221; with its quiet vein of sly
simplicity; &#8220;Willie brewed a peck o&#8217; maut,&#8221; the first of social, and
&#8220;She&#8217;s fair and fause,&#8221; the first of sarcastic songs, with &#8220;The deil&#8217;s
awa wi&#8217; the Exciseman,&#8221; are all productions of this period&mdash;a period
which had besides its own fears and its own forebodings.</p>

<p>For a while Burns seemed to prosper in his farm: he held the plough
with his own hand, he guided the harrows, he distributed the seed-corn
equally among the furrows, and he reaped the crop in its season, and
saw it safely covered in from the storms of winter with &#8220;thack and
rape;&#8221; his wife, too, superintended the dairy with a skill which she
had brought from Kyle, and as the harvest, for a season or two, was
abundant, and the dairy yielded butter and cheese for the market, it
seemed that &#8220;the luckless star&#8221; which ruled his lot had relented, and
now shone unboding and benignly. But much more is required than toil
of hand to make a successful farmer, nor will the attention bestowed
only by fits and starts, compensate for carelessness or oversight:
frugality, not in one thing but in all, is demanded, in small matters
as well as in great, while a careful mind and a vigilant eye must
superintend the labours of servants, and the whole system of in-door
and out-door economy. Now, during the three years which Burns stayed
in Ellisland, he neither wrought with that constant diligence which
farming demands, nor did he bestow upon it the unremitting attention
of eye and mind which such a farm required: besides his skill in
husbandry was but moderate&mdash;the rent, though of his own fixing, was
too high for him and for the times; the ground, though good, was not
so excellent as he might have had on the same estate&mdash;he employed more
servants than the number of acres demanded, and spread for them a
richer board than common: when we have said this we need not add the
expensive tastes induced by poetry, to keep readers from starting,
when they are told that Burns, at the close of the third year of
occupation, resigned his lease to the landlord, and bade farewell for
ever to the plough. He was not, however, quite desolate; he had for a
year or more been appointed on the excise, and had superintended a
district extending to ten large parishes, with applause; indeed, it
has been assigned as the chief reason for failure in his farm, that
when the plough or the sickle summoned him to the field, he was to be
found, either pursuing the defaulters of the revenue, among the
valleys of Dumfrieshire, or measuring out pastoral verse to the
beauties of the land. He retired to a house in the Bank-vennel of
Dumfries, and commenced a town-life: he commenced it with an empty
pocket, for Ellisland had swallowed up all the profits of his poems:
he had now neither a barn to produce meal nor barley, a barn-yard to
yield a fat hen, a field to which he could go at Martinmas for a mart,
nor a dairy to supply milk and cheese and butter to the table&mdash;he had,
in short, all to buy and little to buy with. He regarded it as a
compensation that he had no farm-rent to provide, no bankruptcies to
dread, no horse to keep, for his excise duties were now confined to
Dumfries, and that the burthen of a barren farm was removed from his
mind, and his muse at liberty to renew her unsolicited strains.</p>

<p>But from the day of his departure from &#8220;the barren&#8221; Ellisland, the
downward course of Burns may be dated. The cold neglect of his country
had driven him back indignantly to the plough, and he hoped to gain
from the furrowed field that independence which it was the duty of
Scotland to have provided: but he did not resume the plough with all
the advantages he possessed when he first forsook it: he had revelled
in the luxuries of polished life&mdash;his tastes had been rendered
expensive as well as pure: he had witnessed, and he hoped for the
pleasures of literary retirement, while the hands which had led
jewelled dames over scented carpets to supper tables leaded with
silver took hold of the hilts of the plough with more of reluctance
than good-will. Edinburgh, with its lords and its ladies, its delights
and its hopes, spoiled him for farming. Nor were his new labours more
acceptable to his haughty spirit than those of the plough: the excise
for a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xlix" id="Page_xlix">[xlix]</a></span> century had been a word of opprobrium or of hatred in the
north: the duties which it imposed were regarded, not by peasants
alone, as a serious encroachment upon the ancient rights of the
nation, and to mislead a gauger, or resist him, even to blood, was
considered by few as a fault. That the brightest genius of the
nation&mdash;one whose tastes and sensibilities were so peculiarly its
own&mdash;should be, as a reward, set to look after run-rum and smuggled
tobacco, and to gauge ale-wife&#8217;s barrels, was a regret and a marvel to
many, and a source of bitter merriment to Burns himself.</p>

<p>The duties of his situation were however performed punctually, if not
with pleasure: he was a vigilant officer; he was also a merciful and
considerate one: though loving a joke, and not at all averse to a
dram, he walked among suspicious brewers, captious ale-wives, and
frowning shop-keepers as uprightly as courteously: he smoothed the
ruggedest natures into acquiescence by his gayety and humour, and yet
never gave cause for a malicious remark, by allowing his vigilance to
slumber. He was brave, too, and in the capture of an armed smuggler,
in which he led the attack, showed that he neither feared water nor
fire: he loved, also, to counsel the more forward of the smugglers to
abandon their dangerous calling; his sympathy for the helpless poor
induced him to give them now and then notice of his approach; he has
been known to interpret the severe laws of the excise into tenderness
and mercy in behalf of the widow and the fatherless. In all this he
did but his duty to his country and his kind: and his conduct was so
regarded by a very competent and candid judge. &#8220;Let me look at the
books of Burns,&#8221; said Maxwell, of Terraughty, at the meeting of the
district magistrates, &#8220;for they show that an upright officer may be a
merciful one.&#8221; With a salary of some seventy pounds a year, the chance
of a few guineas annually from the future editions of his poems, and
the hope of rising at some distant day to the more lucrative situation
of supervisor, Burns continued to live in Dumfries; first in the
Bank-vennel, and next in a small house in a humble street, since
called by his name.</p>

<p>In his earlier years the poet seems to have scattered songs as thick
as a summer eve scatters its dews; nor did he scatter them less
carelessly: he appears, indeed, to have thought much less of them than
of his poems: the sweet song of Mary Morison, and others not at all
inferior, lay unregarded among his papers till accident called them
out to shine and be admired. Many of these brief but happy
compositions, sometimes with his name, and oftener without, he threw
in dozens at a time into Johnson, where they were noticed only by the
captious Ritson: but now a work of higher pretence claimed a share in
his skill: in September, 1792, he was requested by George Thomson to
render, for his national collection, the poetry worthy of the muses of
the north, and to take compassion on many choice airs, which had
waited for a poet like the author of the Cotter&#8217;s Saturday Night, to
wed them to immortal verse. To engage in such an undertaking, Burns
required small persuasion, and while Thomson asked for strains
delicate and polished, the poet characteristically stipulated that his
contributions were to be without remuneration, and the language
seasoned with a sprinkling of the Scottish dialect. As his heart was
much in the matter, he began to pour out verse with a readiness and
talent unknown in the history of song: his engagement with Thomson,
and his esteem for Johnson, gave birth to a series of songs as
brilliant as varied, and as naturally easy as they were gracefully
original. In looking over those very dissimilar collections it is not
difficult to discover that the songs which he wrote for the more
stately work, while they are more polished and elegant than those
which he contributed to the less pretending one, are at the same time
less happy in their humour and less simple in their pathos. &#8220;What
pleases <i>me</i> as simple and naive,&#8221; says Burns to Thomson, &#8220;disgusts
<i>you</i> as ludicrous and low. For this reason &#8216;Fye, gie me my coggie,
sirs,&#8217; &#8216;Fye, let us a&#8217; to the bridal,&#8217; with several others of that
cast, are to me highly pleasing, while &#8216;Saw ye my Father&#8217; delights me
with its descriptive simple pathos:&#8221; we read in these words the
reasons of the difference between the lyrics of the two collections.</p>

<p>The land where the poet lived furnished ready materials for song:
hills with fine woods, vales with clear waters, and dames as lovely as
any recorded in verse, were to be had in his walks and his visits;
while, for the purposes of mirth or of humour, characters, in whose
faces originality was legibly written, were as numerous in Nithsdale
as he had found them in the west. He had been reproached, while in
Kyle, with seeing charms in very ordinary looks, and hanging the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_l" id="Page_l">[l]</a></span>
garlands of the muse on unlovely altars; he was liable to no such
censure in Nithsdale; he poured out the incense of poetry only on the
fair and captivating: his Jeans, his Lucys, his Phillises, and his
Jessies were ladies of such mental or personal charms as the
Reynolds&#8217;s and the Lawrences of the time would have rejoiced to lay
out their choicest colours on. But he did not limit himself to the
charms of those whom he could step out to the walks and admire: his
lyrics give evidence of the wandering of his thoughts to the distant
or the dead&mdash;he loves to remember Charlotte Hamilton and Mary
Campbell, and think of the sighs and vows on the Devon and the Doon,
while his harpstrings were still quivering to the names of the Millers
and the M&#8217;Murdos&mdash;to the charms of the lasses with golden or with
flaxen locks, in the valley where he dwelt. Of Jean M&#8217;Murdo and her
sister Phillis he loved to sing; and their beauty merited his strains:
to one who died in her bloom, Lucy Johnston, he addressed a song of
great sweetness; to Jessie Lewars, two or three songs of gratitude and
praise: nor did he forget other beauties, for the accomplished Mrs.
Riddel is remembered, and the absence of fair Clarinda is lamented in
strains both impassioned and pathetic.</p>

<p>But the main inspirer of the latter songs of Burns was a young woman
of humble birth: of a form equal to the most exquisite proportions of
sculpture, with bloom on her cheeks, and merriment in her large bright
eyes, enough to drive an amatory poet crazy. Her name was Jean
Lorimer; she was not more than seventeen when the poet made her
acquaintance, and though she had got a sort of brevet-right from an
officer of the army, to use his southron name of Whelpdale, she loved
best to be addressed by her maiden designation, while the poet chose
to veil her in the numerous lyrics, to which she gave life, under the
names of &#8220;Chloris,&#8221; &#8220;The lass of Craigie-burnwood,&#8221; and &#8220;The lassie
wi&#8217; the lintwhite locks.&#8221; Though of a temper not much inclined to
conceal anything, Burns complied so tastefully with the growing demand
of the age for the exterior decencies of life, that when the scrupling
dames of Caledonia sung a new song in her praise, they were as
unconscious whence its beauties came, as is the lover of art, that the
shape and gracefulness of the marble nymph which he admires, are
derived from a creature who sells the use of her charms indifferently
to sculpture or to love. Fine poetry, like other arts called fine,
springs from &#8220;strange places,&#8221; as the flower in the fable said, when
it bloomed on the dunghill; nor is Burns more to be blamed than was
Raphael, who painted Madonnas, and Magdalens with dishevelled hair and
lifted eyes, from a loose lady, whom the pope, &#8220;Holy at Rome&mdash;here
Antichrist,&#8221; charitably prescribed to the artist, while he laboured in
the cause of the church. Of the poetic use which he made of Jean
Lorimer&#8217;s charms, Burns gives this account to Thomson. &#8220;The lady of
whom the song of Craigie-burnwood was made is one of the finest women
in Scotland, and in fact is to me in a manner what Sterne&#8217;s Eliza was
to him&mdash;a mistress, or friend, or what you will, in the guileless
simplicity of platonic love. I assure you that to my lovely friend you
are indebted for many of my best songs. Do you think that the sober
gin-horse routine of my existence could inspire a man with life and
love and joy&mdash;could fire him with enthusiasm, or melt him with pathos,
equal to the genius of your book? No! no! Whenever I want to be more
than ordinary in song&mdash;to be in some degree equal to your diviner
airs&mdash;do you imagine I fast and pray for the celestial emanation?
Quite the contrary. I have a glorious recipe; the very one that for
his own use was invented by the divinity of healing and poesy, when
erst he piped to the flocks of Admetus. I put myself in a regimen of
admiring a fine woman; and in proportion to the adorability of her
charms, in proportion are you delighted with my verses. The lightning
of her eye is the godhead of Parnassus, and the witchery of her smile,
the divinity of Helicon.&#8221;</p>

<p>Most of the songs which he composed under the influences to which I
have alluded are of the first order: &#8220;Bonnie Lesley,&#8221; &#8220;Highland Mary,&#8221;
&#8220;Auld Rob Morris,&#8221; &#8220;Duncan Gray,&#8221; &#8220;Wandering Willie,&#8221; &#8220;Meg o&#8217; the
Mill,&#8221; &#8220;The poor and honest sodger,&#8221; &#8220;Bonnie Jean,&#8221; &#8220;Phillis the
fair,&#8221; &#8220;John Anderson my Jo,&#8221; &#8220;Had I a cave on some wild distant
shore,&#8221; &#8220;Whistle and I&#8217;ll come to you, my lad,&#8221; &#8220;Bruce&#8217;s Address to
his men at Bannockburn,&#8221; &#8220;Auld Lang Syne,&#8221; &#8220;Thine am I, my faithful
fair,&#8221; &#8220;Wilt thou be my dearie,&#8221; &#8220;O Chloris, mark how green the
groves,&#8221; &#8220;Contented wi&#8217; little, and cantie wi&#8217; mair,&#8221; &#8220;Their groves of
sweet myrtle,&#8221; &#8220;Last May a braw wooer came down the long glen,&#8221; &#8220;O
Mally&#8217;s meek, Mally&#8217;s sweet,&#8221; &#8220;Hey for a lass wi&#8217; a tocher,&#8221;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_li" id="Page_li">[li]</a></span> &#8220;Here&#8217;s
a health to ane I loe dear,&#8221; and the &#8220;Fairest maid on Devon banks.&#8221;
Many of the latter lyrics of Burns were more or less altered, to put
them into better harmony with the airs, and I am not the only one who
has wondered that a bard so impetuous and intractable in most matters,
should have become so soft and pliable, as to make changes which too
often sacrificed the poetry for the sake of a fuller and more swelling
sound. It is true that the emphatic notes of the music must find their
echo in the emphatic words of the verse, and that words soft and
liquid are fitter for ladies&#8217; lips, than words hissing and rough; but
it is also true that in changing a harsher word for one more
harmonious the sense often suffers, and that happiness of expression,
and that dance of words which lyric verse requires, lose much of their
life and vigour. The poet&#8217;s favourite walk in composing his songs was
on a beautiful green sward on the northern side of the Nith, opposite
Lincluden: and his favourite posture for composition at home was
balancing himself on the hind legs of his arm-chair.</p>

<p>While indulging in these lyrical nights, politics penetrated into
Nithsdale, and disturbed the tranquillity of that secluded region.
First, there came a contest far the representation of the Dumfries
district of boroughs, between Patrick Miller, younger, of Dalswinton,
and Sir James Johnstone, of Westerhall, and some two years afterwards,
a struggle for the representation of the county of Kirkcudbright,
between the interest of the Stewarts, of Galloway, and Patrick Heron,
of Kerroughtree. In the first of these the poet mingled discretion
with his mirth, and raised a hearty laugh, in which both parties
joined; for this sobriety of temper, good reasons may be assigned:
Miller, the elder, of Dalswinton, had desired to oblige him in the
affair of Ellisland, and his firm and considerate friend, M&#8217;Murdo, of
Drumlanrig, was chamberlain to his Grace of Queensbury, on whoso
interest Miller stood. On the other hand, his old Jacobitical
affections made him the secret well-wisher to Westerhall, for up to
this time, at least till acid disappointment and the democratic
doctrine of the natural equality of man influenced him, Burns, or as a
western rhymer of his day and district worded the reproach&mdash;Rob was a
Tory. His situation, it will therefore be observed, disposed him to
moderation, and accounts for the milkiness of his Epistle to Fintray,
in which he marshals the chiefs of the contending factions, and
foretells the fierceness of the strife, without pretending to foresee
the event. Neither is he more explicit, though infinitely more
humorous, in his ballad of &#8220;The Five Carlins,&#8221; in which he
impersonates the five boroughs&mdash;Dumfries, Kirkcudbright, Lochmaben,
Sanquhar, and Annan, and draws their characters as shrewd and
calculating dames, met in much wrath and drink to choose a
representative.</p>

<p>But the two or three years which elapsed between the election for the
boroughs, and that for the county adjoining, wrought a serious change
in the temper as well as the opinions of the poet. His Jacobitism, as
has been said was of a poetic kind, and put on but in obedience to old
feelings, and made no part of the man: he was in his heart as
democratic as the kirk of Scotland, which educated him&mdash;he
acknowledged no other superiority but the mental: &#8220;he was disposed,
too,&#8221; said Professor Walker, &#8220;from constitutional temper, from
education and the accidents of life, to a jealousy of power, and a
keen hostility against every system which enabled birth and opulence
to anticipate those rewards which he conceived to belong to genius and
virtue.&#8221; When we add to this, a resentment of the injurious treatment
of the dispensers of public patronage, who had neglected his claims,
and showered pensions and places on men unworthy of being named with
him, we have assigned causes for the change of side and the tone of
asperity and bitterness infused into &#8220;The Heron Ballads.&#8221; Formerly
honey was mixed with his gall: a little praise sweetened his censure:
in these election lampoons he is fierce and even venomous:&mdash;no man has
a head but what is empty, nor a heart that is not black: men descended
without reproach from lines of heroes are stigmatized as cowards, and
the honest and conscientious are reproached as miserly, mean, and
dishonourable. Such is the spirit of party. &#8220;I have privately,&#8221; thus
writes the poet to Heron, &#8220;printed a good many copies of the ballads,
and have sent them among friends about the country. You have already,
as your auxiliary, the sober detestation of mankind on the heads of
your opponents; find I swear by the lyre of Thalia, to muster on your
side all the votaries of honest laughter and fair, candid ridicule.&#8221;
The ridicule was uncandid, and the laughter dishonest. The poet was
unfortunate in his political attachments: Miller gained the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lii" id="Page_lii">[lii]</a></span> boroughs
which Burns wished he might lose, and Heron lost the county which he
foretold he would gain. It must also be recorded against the good
taste of the poet, that he loved to recite &#8220;The Heron Ballads,&#8221; and
reckon them among his happiest compositions.</p>

<p>From attacking others, the poet was&mdash;in the interval between penning
these election lampoons&mdash;called on to defend himself: for this he
seems to have been quite unprepared, though in those yeasty times he
might have expected it. &#8220;I have been surprised, confounded, and
distracted,&#8221; he thus writes to Graham, of Fintray, &#8220;by Mr. Mitchell,
the collector, telling me that he has received an order from your
board to inquire into my political conduct, and blaming me as a person
disaffected to government. Sir, you are a husband and a father: you
know what you would feel, to see the much-loved wife of your bosom,
and your helpless prattling little ones, turned adrift into the world,
degraded and disgraced, from a situation in which they had been
respectable and respected. I would not tell a deliberate falsehood,
no, not though even worse horrors, if worse can be than those I have
mentioned, hung over my head, and I say that the allegation, whatever
villain has made it, is a lie! To the British constitution, on
Revolution principles, next after my God, I am devotedly attached. To
your patronage as a man of some genius, you have allowed me a claim;
and your esteem as an honest man I know is my due. To these, sir,
permit me to appeal: by these I adjure you to save me from that misery
which threatens to overwhelm me, and which with my latest breath I
will say I have not deserved.&#8221; In this letter, another, intended for
the eye of the Commissioners of the Board of Excise, was enclosed, in
which he disclaimed entertaining the idea of a British republic&mdash;a
wild dream of the day&mdash;but stood by the principles of the constitution
of 1688, with the wish to see such corruptions as had crept in,
amended. This last remark, it appears, by a letter from the poet to
Captain Erskine, afterwards Earl of Mar, gave great offence, for
Corbet, one of the superiors, was desired to inform him, &#8220;that his
business was to act, and not to think; and that whatever might be men
or measures, it was his duty to be silent and obedient.&#8221; The
intercession of Fintray, and the explanations of Burns, were so far
effectual, that his political offense was forgiven, &#8220;only I
understand,&#8221; said he, &#8220;that all hopes of my getting officially forward
are blasted.&#8221; The records of the Excise Office exhibit no trace of
this memorable matter, and two noblemen, who were then in the
government, have assured me that this harsh proceeding received no
countenance at head-quarters, and must have originated with some
ungenerous or malicious person, on whom the poet had spilt a little of
the nitric acid of his wrath.</p>

<p>That Burns was numbered among the republicans of Dumfries I well
remember: but then those who held different sentiments from the men in
power, were all, in that loyal town, stigmatized as democrats: that he
either desired to see the constitution changed, or his country invaded
by the liberal French, who proposed to set us free with the bayonet,
and then admit us to the &#8220;fraternal embrace,&#8221; no one ever believed. It
is true that he spoke of premiers and peers with contempt; that he
hesitated to take off his hat in the theatre, to the air of &#8220;God save
the king;&#8221; that he refused to drink the health of Pitt, saying he
preferred that of Washington&mdash;a far greater man; that he wrote bitter
words against that combination of princes, who desired to put down
freedom in France; that he said the titled spurred and the wealthy
switched England and Scotland like two hack-horses; and that all the
high places of the land, instead of being filled by genius and talent,
were occupied, as were the high-places of Israel, with idols of wood
or of stone. But all this and more had been done and said before by
thousands in this land, whose love of their country was never
questioned. That it was bad taste to refuse to remove his hat when
other heads were bared, and little better to refuse to pledge in
company the name of Pitt, because he preferred Washington, cannot
admit of a doubt; but that he deserved to be written down traitor, for
mere matters of whim or caprice, or to be turned out of the unenvied
situation of &#8220;gauging auld wives&#8217; barrels,&#8221; because he thought there
were some stains on the white robe of the constitution, seems a sort
of tyranny new in the history of oppression. His love of country is
recorded in too many undying lines to admit of a doubt now: nor is it
that chivalrous love alone which men call romantic; it is a love which
may be laid up in every man&#8217;s heart and practised in every man&#8217;s life;
the words are homely, but the words of Burns are always expressive:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_liii" id="Page_liii">[liii]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>But while verses, deserving as these do to become the national motto,
and sentiments loyal and generous, were overlooked and forgotten, all
his rash words about freedom, and his sarcastic sallies about thrones
and kings, were treasured up to his injury, by the mean and the
malicious. His steps were watched and his words weighed; when he
talked with a friend in the street, he was supposed to utter sedition;
and when ladies retired from the table, and the wine circulated with
closed doors, he was suspected of treason rather than of toasting,
which he often did with much humour, the charms of woman; even when he
gave as a sentiment, &#8220;May our success be equal to the justice of our
cause,&#8221; he was liable to be challenged by some gunpowder captain, who
thought that we deserved success in war, whether right or wrong. It is
true that he hated with a most cordial hatred all who presumed on
their own consequence, whether arising from wealth, titles, or
commissions in the army; officers he usually called &#8220;the epauletted
puppies,&#8221; and lords he generally spoke of as &#8220;feather-headed fools,&#8221;
who could but strut and stare and be no answer in kind to retort his
satiric flings, his unfriends reported that it was unsafe for young
men to associate with one whose principles were democratic, and
scarcely either modest or safe for young women to listen to a poet
whose notions of female virtue were so loose and his songs so free.
These sentiments prevailed so far that a gentleman on a visit from
London, told me he was dissuaded from inviting Burns to a dinner,
given by way of welcome back to his native place, because he was the
associate of democrats and loose people; and when a modest dame of
Dumfries expressed, through a friend, a wish to have but the honour of
speaking to one of whose genius she was an admirer, the poet declined
the interview, with a half-serious smile, saying, &#8220;Alas! she is
handsome, and you know the character publicly assigned to me.&#8221; She
escaped the danger of being numbered, it is likely, with the Annas and
the Chlorises of his freer strains.</p>

<p>The neglect of his country, the tyranny of the Excise, and the
downfall of his hopes and fortunes, were now to bring forth their
fruits&mdash;the poet&#8217;s health began to decline. His drooping looks, his
neglect of his person, his solitary saunterings, his escape from the
stings of reflection into socialities, and his distempered joy in the
company of beauty, all spoke, as plainly as with a tongue, of a
sinking heart and a declining body. Yet though he was sensible of
sinking health, hope did not at once desert him: he continued to pour
out such tender strains, and to show such flashes of wit and humour at
the call of Thomson, as are recorded of no other lyrist: neither did
he, when in company after his own mind, hang the head, and speak
mournfully, but talked and smiled and still charmed all listeners by
his witty vivacities.</p>

<p>On the 20th of June, 1795, he writes thus of his fortunes and
condition to his friend Clarke, &#8220;Still, still the victim of
affliction; were you to see the emaciated figure who now holds the pen
to you, you would not know your old friend. Whether I shall ever get
about again is only known to HIM, the Great Unknown, whoso creature I
am. Alas, Clarke, I begin to fear the worst! As to my individual self
I am tranquil, and would despise myself if I were not: but Burns&#8217;s
poor widow and half-a-dozen of his dear little ones, helpless orphans!
<i>Here</i> I am as weak as a woman&#8217;s tear. Enough of this! &#8217;tis half my
disease. I duly received your last, enclosing the note: it came
extremely in time, and I am much obliged to your punctuality. Again I
must request you to do me the same kindness. Be so very good as by
return of post to enclose me <i>another</i> note: I trust you can do so
without inconvenience, and it will seriously oblige me. If I must go,
I leave a few friends behind me, whom I shall regret while
consciousness remains. I know I shall live in their remembrance. O,
dear, dear Clarke! that I shall ever see you again is I am afraid
highly improbable.&#8221; This remarkable letter proves both the declining
health, and the poverty of the poet: his digestion was so bad that he
could taste neither flesh nor fish: porridge and milk he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_liv" id="Page_liv">[liv]</a></span> could alone
swallow, and that but in small quantities. When it is recollected that
he had no more than thirty shillings a week to keep house, and live
like a gentleman, no one need wonder that his wife had to be obliged
to a generous neighbour for some of the chief necessaries for her
coming confinement, and that the poet had to beg, in extreme need, two
guinea notes from a distant friend.</p>

<p>His sinking state was not unobserved by his friends, and Syme and
M&#8217;Murdo united with Dr. Maxwell in persuading him, at the beginning of
the summer, to seek health at the Brow-well, a few miles east of
Dumfries, where there were pleasant walks on the Solway-side, and
salubrious breezes from the sea, which it was expected would bring the
health to the poet they had brought to many. For a while, his looks
brightened up, and health seemed inclined to return: his friend, the
witty and accomplished Mrs. Riddel, who was herself ailing, paid him a
visit. &#8220;I was struck,&#8221; she said, &#8220;with his appearance on entering the
room: the stamp of death was impressed on his features. His first
words were, &#8216;Well, Madam, have you any commands for the other world?&#8217;
I replied that it seemed a doubtful case which of us should be there
soonest; he looked in my face with an air of great kindness, and
expressed his concern at seeing me so ill, with his usual sensibility.
At table he ate little or nothing: we had a long conversation about
his present state, and the approaching termination of all his earthly
prospects. He showed great concern about his literary fame, and
particularly the publication of his posthumous works; he said he was
well aware that his death would occasion some noise, and that every
scrap of his writing would be revived against him, to the injury of
his future reputation; that letters and verses, written with unguarded
freedom, would be handed about by vanity or malevolence when no dread
of his resentment would restrain them, or prevent malice or envy from
pouring forth their venom on his name. I had seldom seen his mind
greater, or more collected. There was frequently a considerable degree
of vivacity in his sallies; but the concern and dejection I could not
disguise, damped the spirit of pleasantry he seemed willing to
indulge.&#8221; This was on the evening of the 5th of July; another lady who
called to see him, found him seated at a window, gazing on the sun,
then setting brightly on the summits of the green hills of Nithsdale.
&#8220;Look how lovely the sun is,&#8221; said the poet, &#8220;but he will soon have
done with shining for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>He now longed for home: his wife, whom he ever tenderly loved, was
about to be confined in child-bed: his papers were in sad confusion,
and required arrangement; and he felt that desire to die, at least,
among familiar things and friendly faces, so common to our nature. He
had not long before, though much reduced in pocket, refused with scorn
an offer of fifty pounds, which a speculating bookseller made, for
leave to publish his looser compositions; he had refused an offer of
the like sum yearly, from Perry of the Morning Chronicle, for poetic
contributions to his paper, lest it might embroil him with the ruling
powers, and he had resented the remittance of five pounds from
Thomson, on account of his lyric contributions, and desired him to do
so no more, unless he wished to quarrel with him; but his necessities
now, and they had at no time been so great, induced him to solicit
five pounds from Thomson, and ten pounds from his cousin, James
Burness, of Montrose, and to beg his friend Alexander Cunningham to
intercede with the Commissioners of Excise, to depart from their usual
practice, and grant him his full salary; &#8220;for without that,&#8221; he added,
&#8220;if I die not of disease, I must perish with hunger.&#8221; Thomson sent the
five pounds, James Burness sent the ten, but the Commissioners of
Excise refused to be either merciful or generous. Stobie, a young
expectant in the customs, was both;&mdash;he performed the duties of the
dying poet, and refused to touch the salary. The mind of Burns was
haunted with the fears of want and the terrors of a jail; nor were
those fears without foundation; one Williamson, to whom he was
indebted for the cloth to make his volunteer regimentals, threatened
the one; and a feeling that he was without money for either his own
illness or the confinement of his wife, threatened the other.</p>

<p>Burns returned from the Brow-well, on the 18th of July: as he walked
from the little carriage which brought him up the Mill hole-brae to
his own door, he trembled much, and stooped with weakness and pain,
and kept his feet with difficulty: his looks were woe-worn and
ghastly, and no one who saw him, and there were several, expected to
see him again in life. It was soon circulated through Dumfries, that
Burns had returned worse from the Brow-well; that Maxwell thought ill
of him, and that, in truth, he was dying. The anxiety of all classes
was great; dif<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lv" id="Page_lv">[lv]</a></span>ferences of opinion were forgotten, in sympathy for his
early fate: wherever two or three were met together their talk was of
Burns, of his rare wit, matchless humour, the vivacity of his
conversation, and the kindness of his heart. To the poet himself,
death, which he now knew was at hand, brought with it no fear; his
good-humour, which small matters alone ruffled, did not forsake him,
and his wit was ever ready. He was poor&mdash;he gave his pistols, which he
had used against the smugglers on the Solway, to his physician, adding
with a smile, that he had tried them and found them an honour to their
maker, which was more than he could say of the bulk of mankind! He was
proud&mdash;he remembered the indifferent practice of the corps to which he
belonged, and turning to Gibson, one of his fellow-soldiers, who stood
at his bedside with wet eyes, &#8220;John,&#8221; said he, and a gleam of humour
passed over his face, &#8220;pray don&#8217;t let the awkward-squad fire over me.&#8221;
It was almost the last act of his life to copy into his Common-place
Book, the letters which contained the charge against him of the
Commissioners of Excise, and his own eloquent refutation, leaving
judgment to be pronounced by the candour of posterity.</p>

<p>It has been injuriously said of Burns, by Coleridge, that the man
sunk, but the poet was bright to the last: he did not sink in the
sense that these words imply: the man was manly to the latest draught
of breath. That he was a poet to the last, can be proved by facts, as
well as by the word of the author of Christabel. As he lay silently
growing weaker and weaker, he observed Jessie Lewars, a modest and
beautiful young creature, and sister to one of his brethren of the
Excise, watching over him with moist eyes, and tending him with the
care of a daughter; he rewarded her with one of those songs which are
an insurance against forgetfulness. The lyrics of the north have
nothing finer than this exquisite stanza:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;Altho&#8217; thou maun never be mine,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Altho&#8217; even hope is denied,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8217;Tis sweeter for thee despairing,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Than aught in the world beside.&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>His thoughts as he lay wandered to Charlotte Hamilton, and he
dedicated some beautiful stanzas to her beauty and her coldness,
beginning, &#8220;Fairest maid on Devon banks.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was a sad sight to see the poet gradually sinking; his wife in
hourly expectation of her sixth confinement, and his four helpless
children&mdash;a daughter, a sweet child, had died the year before&mdash;with no
one of their lineage to soothe them with kind words or minister to
their wants. Jessie Lewars, with equal prudence and attention, watched
over them all: she could not help seeing that the thoughts of the
desolation which his death would bring, pressed sorely on him, for he
loved his children, and hoped much from his boys. He wrote to his
father-in-law, James Armour, at Mauchline, that he was dying, his wife
nigh her confinement, and begged that his mother-in-law would hasten
to them and speak comfort. He wrote to Mrs. Dunlop, saying, &#8220;I have
written to you so often without receiving any answer that I would not
trouble you again, but for the circumstances in which I am. An illness
which has long hung about me in all probability will speedily send me
beyond that bourne whence no traveller returns. Your friendship, with
which for many years you honoured me, was a friendship dearest to my
soul: your conversation and your correspondence were at once highly
entertaining and instructive&mdash;with what pleasure did I use to break up
the seal! The remembrance yet adds one pulse more to my poor
palpitating heart. Farewell!&#8221; A tremor pervaded his frame; his tongue
grew parched, and he was at times delirious: on the fourth day after
his return, when his attendant, James Maclure, held his medicine to
his lips, he swallowed it eagerly, rose almost wholly up, spread out
his hands, sprang forward nigh the whole length of the bed, fell on
his face, and expired. He died on the 21st of July, when nearly
thirty-seven years and seven months old.</p>

<p>The burial of Burns, on the 25th of July, was an impressive and
mournful scene: half the people of Nithsdale and the neighbouring
parts of Galloway had crowded into Dumfries, to see their poet
&#8220;mingled with the earth,&#8221; and not a few had been permitted to look at
his body, laid out for interment. It was a calm and beautiful day, and
as the body was borne along the street towards the old kirk-yard, by
his brethren of the volunteers, not a sound was heard but the measured
step and the solemn music: there was no impatient crushing, no fierce
elbowing&mdash;the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lvi" id="Page_lvi">[lvi]</a></span> crowd which filled the street seemed conscious of what
they were now losing for ever. Even while this pageant was passing,
the widow of the poet was taken in labour; but the infant born in that
unhappy hour soon shared his father&#8217;s grave. On reaching the northern
nook of the kirk-yard, where the grave was made, the mourners halted;
the coffin was divested of the mort-cloth, and silently lowered to its
resting-place, and as the first shovel-full of earth fell on the lid,
the volunteers, too agitated to be steady, justified the fears of the
poet, by three ragged volleys. He who now writes this very brief and
imperfect account, was present: he thought then, as he thinks now,
that all the military array of foot and horse did not harmonize with
either the genius or the fortunes of the poet, and that the tears
which he saw on many cheeks around, as the earth was replaced, were
worth all the splendour of a show which mocked with unintended mockery
the burial of the poor and neglected Burns. The body of the poet was,
on the 5th of June, 1815, removed to a more commodious spot in the
same burial-ground&mdash;his dark, and waving locks looked then fresh and
glossy&mdash;to afford room for a marble monument, which embodies, with
neither skill nor grace, that well-known passage in the dedication to
the gentlemen of the Caledonian Hunt:&mdash;&#8220;The poetic genius of my
country found me, as the prophetic bard, Elijah, did Elisha, at the
plough, and threw her inspiring mantle over me.&#8221; The dust of the bard
was again disturbed, when the body of Mrs. Burns was laid, in April,
1834, beside the remains of her husband: his skull was dug up by the
district craniologists, to satisfy their minds by measurement that he
was equal to the composition of &#8220;Tam o&#8217; Shanter,&#8221; or &#8220;Mary in Heaven.&#8221;
This done, they placed the skull in a leaden box, &#8220;carefully lined
with the softest materials,&#8221; and returned it, we hope for ever, to the
hallowed ground.</p>

<p>Thus lived and died Robert Burns, the chief of Scottish poets: in his
person he was tall and sinewy, and of such strength and activity, that
Scott alone, of all the poets I have seen, seemed his equal: his
forehead was broad, his hair black, with an inclination to curl, his
visage uncommonly swarthy, his eyes large, dark and lustrous, and his
voice deep and manly. His sensibility was strong, his passions full to
overflowing, and he loved, nay, adored, whatever was gentle and
beautiful. He had, when a lad at the plough, an eloquent word and an
inspired song for every fair face that smiled on him, and a sharp
sarcasm or a fierce lampoon for every rustic who thwarted or
contradicted him. As his first inspiration came from love, he
continued through life to love on, and was as ready with the lasting
incense of the muse for the ladies of Nithsdale as for the lasses of
Kyle: his earliest song was in praise of a young girl who reaped by
his side, when he was seventeen&mdash;his latest in honour of a lady by
whose side he had wandered and dreamed on the banks of the Devon. He
was of a nature proud and suspicious, and towards the close of his
life seemed disposed to regard all above him in rank as men who
unworthily possessed the patrimony of genius: he desired to see the
order of nature restored, and worth and talent in precedence of the
base or the dull. He had no medium in his hatred or his love; he never
spared the stupid, as if they were not to be endured because he was
bright; and on the heads of the innocent possessors of titles or
wealth he was ever ready to shower his lampoons. He loved to start
doubts in religion which he knew inspiration only could solve, and he
spoke of Calvinism with a latitude of language that grieved pious
listeners. He was warm-hearted and generous to a degree, above all
men, and scorned all that was selfish and mean with a scorn quite
romantic. He was a steadfast friend and a good neighbour: while he
lived at Ellisland few passed his door without being entertained at
his table; and even when in poverty, on the Millhole-brae, the poor
seldom left his door but with blessings on their lips.</p>

<p>Of his modes of study he has himself informed us, as well as of the
seasons and the places in which he loved to muse. He composed while he
strolled along the secluded banks of the Doon, the Ayr, or the Nith:
as the images crowded on his fancy his pace became quickened, and in
his highest moods he was excited even to tears. He loved the winter
for its leafless trees, its swelling floods, and its winds which swept
along the gloomy sky, with frost and snow on their wings: but he loved
the autumn more&mdash;he has neglected to say why&mdash;the muse was then more
liberal of her favours, and he composed with a happy alacrity unfelt
in all other seasons. He filled his mind and heart with the materials
of song&mdash;and retired from gazing on woman&#8217;s beauty,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lvii" id="Page_lvii">[lvii]</a></span> and from the
excitement of her charms, to record his impressions in verse, as a
painter delineates oil his canvas the looks of those who sit to his
pencil. His chief place of study at Ellisland is still remembered: it
extends along the river-bank towards the Isle: there the neighbouring
gentry love to walk and peasants to gather, and hold it sacred, as the
place where he composed Tam O&#8217; Shanter. His favourite place of study
when residing in Dumfries, was the ruins of Lincluden College, made
classic by that sublime ode, &#8220;The Vision,&#8221; and that level and clovery
sward contiguous to the College, on the northern side of the Nith: the
latter place was his favourite resort; it is known now by the name of
Burns&#8217;s musing ground, and there he conceived many of his latter
lyrics. In case of interruption he completed the verses at the
fireside, where he swung to and fro in his arm-chair till the task was
done: he then submitted the song to the ordeal of his wife&#8217;s voice,
which was both sweet and clear, and while she sung he listened
attentively, and altered or amended till the whole was in harmony,
music and words.</p>

<p>The genius of Burns is of a high order: in brightness of expression
and unsolicited ease and natural vehemence of language, he stands in
the first rank of poets: in choice of subjects, in happiness of
conception, and loftiness of imagination, he recedes into the second.
He owes little of his fame to his objects, for, saving the beauty of a
few ladies, they were all of an ordinary kind: he sought neither in
romance nor in history for themes to the muse; he took up topics from
life around which were familiar to all, and endowed them with
character, with passion, with tenderness, with humour&mdash;elevating all
that he touched into the regions of poetry and morals. He went to no
far lands for the purpose of surprising us with wonders, neither did
he go to crowns or coronets to attract the stare of the peasantry
around him, by things which to them were as a book shut and sealed:
&#8220;The Daisy&#8221; grew on the lands which he ploughed; &#8220;The Mouse&#8221; built her
frail nest on his own stubble-field; &#8220;The Haggis&#8221; reeked on his own
table; &#8220;The Scotch Drink&#8221; of which he sang was the produce of a
neighbouring still; &#8220;The Twa Dogs,&#8221; which conversed so wisely and
wittily, were, one of them at least, his own collies; &#8220;The Vision&#8221; is
but a picture, and a brilliant one, of his own hopes and fears; &#8220;Tam
Samson&#8221; was a friend whom he loved; &#8220;Doctor Hornbook&#8221; a neighbouring
pedant; &#8220;Matthew Henderson&#8221; a social captain on half-pay; &#8220;The Scotch
Bard&#8221; who had gone to the West Indies was Burns himself; the heroine
of &#8220;The Lament,&#8221; was Jean Armour; and &#8220;Tam O&#8217; Shanter&#8221; a facetious
farmer of Kyle, who rode late and loved pleasant company, nay, even
&#8220;The Deil&#8221; himself, whom he had the hardihood to address, was a being
whose eldrich croon bad alarmed the devout matrons of Kyle, and had
wandered, not unseen by the bard himself, among the lonely glens of
the Doon. Burns was one of the first to teach the world that high
moral poetry resided in the humblest subjects: whatever he touched
became elevated; his spirit possessed and inspired the commonest
topics, and endowed them with life and beauty.</p>

<p>His songs have all the beauties and but few of them the faults of his
poems: they flow to the music as readily as if both air and words came
into the world together. The sentiments are from nature, they are
rarely strained or forced, and the words dance in their places and
echo the music in its pastoral sweetness, social glee, or in the
tender and the moving. He seems always to write with woman&#8217;s eye upon
him: he is gentle, persuasive and impassioned: he appears to watch her
looks, and pours out his praise or his complaint according to the
changeful moods of her mind. He looks on her, too, with a sculptor&#8217;s
as well as a poet&#8217;s eye: to him who works in marble, the diamonds,
emeralds, pearls, and elaborate ornaments of gold, but load and injure
the harmony of proportion, the grace of form, and divinity of
sentiment of his nymph or his goddess&mdash;so with Burns the fashion of a
lady&#8217;s boddice, the lustre of her satins, or the sparkle of her
diamonds, or other finery with which wealth or taste has loaded her,
are neglected us idle frippery; while her beauty, her form, or her
mind, matters which are of nature and not of fashion, are remembered
and praised. He is none of the millinery bards, who deal in scented
silks, spider-net laces, rare gems, set in rarer workmanship, and who
shower diamonds and pearls by the bushel on a lady&#8217;s locks: he makes
bright eyes, flushing cheeks, the magic of the tongue, and the
&#8220;pulses&#8217; maddening play&#8221; perform all. His songs are, in general,
pastoral pictures: he seldom finishes a portrait of female beauty
without enclosing it in a natural frame-work of waving woods, running
streams, the melody of birds, and the lights of heaven.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lviii" id="Page_lviii">[lviii]</a></span> Those who
desire to feel Burns in all his force, must seek some summer glen,
when a country girl searches among his many songs for one which
sympathizes with her own heart, and gives it full utterance, till wood
and vale is filled with the melody. It is remarkable that the most
naturally elegant and truly impassioned songs in our literature were
written by a ploughman in honour of the rustic lasses around him.</p>

<p>His poetry is all life and energy, and bears the impress of a warm
heart and a clear understanding: it abounds with passions and
opinions&mdash;vivid pictures of rural happiness and the raptures of
successful love, all fresh from nature and observation, and not as
they are seen through the spectacles of books. The wit of the clouted
shoe is there without its coarseness: there is a prodigality of humour
without licentiousness, a pathos ever natural and manly, a social joy
akin sometimes to sadness, a melancholy not unallied to mirth, and a
sublime morality which seeks to elevate and soothe. To a love of man
he added an affection for the flowers of the valley, the fowls of the
air, and the beasts of the field: he perceived the tie of social
sympathy which united animated with unanimated nature, and in many of
his finest poems most beautifully he has enforced it. His thoughts are
original and his style new and unborrowed: all that he has written is
distinguished by a happy carelessness, a bounding elasticity of
spirit, and a singular felicity of expression, simple yet inimitable;
he is familiar yet dignified, careless, yet correct, and concise, yet
clear and full. All this and much more is embodied in the language of
humble life&mdash;a dialect reckoned barbarous by scholars, but which,
coming from the lips of inspiration, becomes classic and elevated.</p>

<p>The prose of this great poet has much of the original merit of his
verse, but it is seldom so natural and so sustained: it abounds with
fine outflashings and with a genial warmth and vigour, but it is
defaced by false ornament and by a constant anxiety to say fine and
forcible things. He seems not to know that simplicity was as rare and
as needful a beauty in prose as in verse; he covets the pauses of
Sterne and the point and antithesis of Junius, like one who believes
that to write prose well he must be ever lively, ever pointed, and
ever smart. Yet the account which he wrote of himself to Dr. Moore is
one of the most spirited and natural narratives in the language, and
composed in a style remote from the strained and groped-for witticisms
and put-on sensibilities of many of his letters:&mdash;&#8220;Simple,&#8221; as John
Wilson says, &#8220;we may well call it; rich in fancy, overflowing in
feeling, and dashed off in every other paragraph with the easy
boldness of a great master.&#8221;</p>

<h2><a name="PREFACE_1" id="PREFACE_1"></a>PREFACE.</h2>


<p>[The first edition, printed at Kilmarnock, July, 1786, by John Wilson,
bore on the title-page these simple words:&mdash;&#8220;Poems, chiefly in the
Scottish Dialect, by Robert Burns;&#8221; the following motto, marked
&#8220;Anonymous,&#8221; but evidently the poet&#8217;s own composition, was more
ambitious:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;The simple Bard, unbroke by rules of art,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He pours the wild effusions of the heart:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And if inspired, &#8217;tis nature&#8217;s pow&#8217;rs inspire&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hers all the melting thrill, and hers the kindling fire.&#8221;]<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The following trifles are not the production of the Poet, who, with
all the advantages of learned art, and perhaps amid the elegancies and
idlenesses of upper life, looks down for a rural theme with an eye to
Theocritus or Virgil. To the author of this, these, and other
celebrated names their countrymen, are, at least in their original
language, <i>a fountain shut up, and a book sealed.</i> Unacquainted with
the necessary requisites for commencing poet by rule, he sings the
sentiments and manners he felt and saw in himself and his rustic
compeers around him in his and their native language. Though a rhymer
from his earliest years, at least from the earliest impulse of the
softer passions, it was not till very lately that the applause,
perhaps the partiality, of friendship awakened his vanity so for as to
make him think anything of his worth showing: and none of the
following works were composed with a view to the press. To amuse
himself with the little creations of his own fancy, amid the toil and
fatigue of a laborious life; to transcribe the various feelings&mdash;the
loves, the griefs, the hopes, the fears&mdash;in his own breast; to find
some kind of counterpoise to the struggles of a world, always an alien
scene, a task uncouth to the poetical mind&mdash;these were his motives for
courting the Muses, and in these he found poetry to be its own reward.</p>

<p>Now that he appears in the public character of an author, he does it
with fear and trembling. So dear is fame to the rhyming tribe, that
even he, an obscure, nameless Bard, shrinks aghast at the thought of
being branded as&mdash;an impertinent blockhead,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lx" id="Page_lx">[lx]</a></span> obtruding his nonsense on
the world; and, because he can make a shift to jingle a few doggerel
Scotch rhymes together, looking upon himself as a poet of no small
consequence, forsooth!</p>

<p>It is an observation of that celebrated poet, Shenstone, whose divine
elegies do honour to our language, our nation, and our species, that
&#8220;<i>Humility</i> has depressed many a genius to a hermit, but never raised
one to fame!&#8221; If any critic catches at the word <i>genius</i> the author
tells him, once for all, that he certainly looks upon himself as
possessed of some poetic abilities, otherwise his publishing in the
manner he has done would be a man&oelig;uvre below the worst character,
which, he hopes, his worst enemy will ever give him. But to the genius
of a Ramsay, or the glorious dawnings of the poor, unfortunate
Fergusson, he, with equal unaffected sincerity, declares, that even in
his highest pulse of vanity, he has not the most distant pretensions.
These two justly admired Scotch poets he has often had in his eye in
the following pieces, but rather with a view to kindle at their flame,
than for servile imitation.</p>

<p>To his Subscriber, the Author returns his most sincere thanks. Not the
mercenary bow over a counter, but the heart-throbbing gratitude of the
Bard, conscious how much he owes to benevolence and friendship for
gratifying him, if he deserves it, in that dearest wish of every
poetic bosom&mdash;to be distinguished. He begs his readers, particularly
the learned and the polite, who may honour him with a perusal, that
they will make every allowance for education and circumstances of
life; but if, after a fair, candid, and impartial criticism, he shall
stand convicted of dulness and nonsense, let him be done by as he
would in that case do by others&mdash;let him be condemned, without mercy,
in contempt and oblivion.</p>

<h3>WINTER.</h3>
<h3>A DIRGE.</h3>
<p>[This is one of the earliest of the poet&#8217;s recorded compositions: it
was written before the death of his father, and is called by Gilbert
Burns, &#8216;a juvenile production.&#8217; To walk by a river while flooded, or
through a wood on a rough winter day, and hear the storm howling among
the leafless trees, exalted the poet&#8217;s thoughts. &#8220;In such a season,&#8221;
he said, &#8220;just after a train of misfortunes, I composed <i>Winter, a

<h5>AN UNCO MOURNFU&#8217; TALE.</h5>
<p>[This tale is partly true; the poet&#8217;s pet ewe got entangled in her
tether, and tumbled into a ditch; the face of ludicrous and awkward
sorrow with which this was related by Hughoc, the herd-boy, amused
Burns so much, who was on his way to the plough, that he immediately
composed the poem, and repeated it to his brother Gilbert when they
met in the evening; the field where the poet held the plough, and the
ditch into which poor Mailie fell, are still pointed out.]</p>

<p>[Burns, when he calls on the bards of Ayr and Doon to join in the
lament for Mailie, intimates that he regards himself as a poet. Hogg
calls it a very elegant morsel: but says that it resembles too closely
&#8220;The Ewie and the Crooked Horn,&#8221; to be admired as original: the
shepherd might have remembered that they both resemble Sempill&#8217;s &#8220;Life

this Epistle to his brother Gilbert, who was much pleased with the
performance, which he considered equal if not superior to some of
Allan Ramsay&#8217;s Epistles, and said if it were printed he had no doubt
that it would be well received by people of taste.] </p>

<h3>SECOND EPISTLE TO DAVIE,</h3>

<h4>A BROTHER POET.</h4>
<p>[David Sillar, to whom these epistles are addressed, was at that time
master of a country school, and was welcome to Burns both as a scholar
and a writer of verse. This epistle he prefixed to his poems printed
at Kilmarnock in the year 1789: he loved to speak of his early
comrade, and supplied Walker with some very valuable anecdotes: he
died one of the magistrates of Irvine, on the 2d of May, 1830, at the
age of seventy.]</p>

<p class="sig2"><span class="smcap">Milton</span></p>

<p>[The beautiful and relenting spirit in which this fine poem finishes
moved the heart on one of the coldest of our critics. &#8220;It was, I
think,&#8221; says Gilbert Burns, &#8220;in the winter of 1784, as we were going
with carts for coals to the family fire, and I could yet point out the
particular spot, that Robert first repeated to me the &#8216;Address to the
Deil.&#8217; The idea of the address was suggested to him by running over in
his mind the many ludicrous accounts we have of that august
personage.&#8221;]</p>

<h5>NEW-YEAR MORNING SALUTATION TO HIS</h5>
<h3>AULD MARE MAGGIE,</h3>
<h5>ON GIVING HER THE ACCUSTOMED RIPP OF CORN TO HANSEL IN THE NEW YEAR</h5>
<p>[&#8220;Whenever Burns has occasion,&#8221; says Hogg, &#8220;to address or mention any
subordinate being, however mean, even a mouse or a flower, then there
is a gentle pathos in it that awakens the finest feelings of the
heart.&#8221; The Auld Farmer of Kyle has the spirit of knight-errant, and
loves his mare according to the rules of chivalry; and well he might:
she carried him safely home from markets, triumphantly from
wedding-brooses; she ploughed the stiffest land; faced the steepest
brae, and, moreover, bore home his bonnie bride with a consciousness
of the loveliness of the load.]</p>

<p>[The vehement nationality of this poem is but a small part of its
merit. The haggis of the north is the minced pie of the south; both
are characteristic of the people: the ingredients which compose the
former are all of Scottish growth, including the bag which contains
them; the ingredients of the latter are gathered chiefly from the four
quarters of the globe: the haggis is the triumph of poverty, the
minced pie the triumph of wealth.]</p>

<h3>A PRAYER,</h3>
<h4>UNDER THE PRESSURE OF VIOLENT ANGUISH.</h4>
<p>[&#8220;There was a certain period of my life,&#8221; says Burns, &#8220;that my spirit
was broke by repeated losses and disasters, which threatened and
indeed effected the ruin of my fortune. My body, too, was attacked by
the most dreadful distemper, a hypochondria or confirmed melancholy.
In this wretched state, the recollection of which makes me yet
shudder, I hung my harp on the willow-trees, except in some lucid
intervals, in one of which I composed the following.&#8221;]</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">O Thou Great Being! what Thou art<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Surpasses me to know;<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Or close them fast in death!<br /></span>

<h3>A PRAYER</h3>
<h4>IN THE PROSPECT OF DEATH.</h4>
<p>[I have heard the third verse of this very moving Prayer quoted by
scrupulous men as a proof that the poet imputed his errors to the
Being who had endowed him with wild and unruly passions. The meaning
is very different: Burns felt the torrent-strength of passion
overpowering his resolution, and trusted that God would be merciful to
the errors of one on whom he had bestowed such o&#8217;ermastering gifts.]</p>

<h3>STANZAS</h3>
<h4>ON THE SAME OCCASION.</h4>
<p>[These verses the poet, in his common-place book, calls &#8220;Misgivings in
the Hour of Despondency and Prospect of Death.&#8221; He elsewhere says they

<h3>REMORSE.</h3>
<h4>A FRAGMENT.</h4>
<p>[&#8220;I entirely agree,&#8221; says Burns, &#8220;with the author of the <i>Theory of
Moral Sentiments</i>, that Remorse is the most painful sentiment that can
embitter the human bosom; an ordinary pitch of fortitude may bear up
admirably well, under those calamities, in the procurement of which we
ourselves have had no hand; but when our follies or crimes have made
us wretched, to bear all with manly firmness, and at the same time
have a proper penitential sense of our misconduct, is a glorious
effort of self-command.&#8221;]</p>

<span class="i0">Of all the numerous ills that hurt our peace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That press the soul, or wring the mind with anguish,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">That to our folly or our guilt we owe.<br /></span>

<h3>THE JOLLY BEGGARS.</h3>
<h4>A CANTATA.</h4>
<p>[This inimitable poem, unknown to Currie and unheardof while the poet
lived, was first given to the world, with other characteristic pieces,
by Mr. Stewart of Glasgow, in the year 1801. Some have surmised that
it is not the work of Burns; but the parentage is certain: the
original manuscript at the time of its composition, in 1785, was put
into the hands of Mr. Richmond of Mauchline, and afterwards given by
Burns himself to Mr. Woodburn, factor of the laird of Craigen-gillan;
the song of &#8220;For a&#8217; that, and a&#8217; that&#8221; was inserted by the poet, with
his name, in the <i>Musical Museum</i> of February, 1790. Cromek admired,
yet did not, from overruling advice, print it in the <i>Reliques</i>, for
which he was sharply censured by Sir Walter Scott, in the <i>Quarterly
Review.</i> The scene of the poem is in Mauchline, where Poosie Nancy had
her change-house. Only one copy in the handwriting of Burns is
supposed to exist; and of it a very accurate fac-simile has been
given.]</p>

<h3>DEATH AND DR. HORNBOOK.</h3>
<h4>A TRUE STORY.</h4>
<p>[John Wilson, raised to the unwelcome elevation of hero to this poem,
was, at the time of its composition, schoolmaster in Tarbolton: he as,
it is said, a fair scholar, and a very worthy man, but vain of his
knowledge in medicine&mdash;so vain, that he advertised his merits, and
offered advice gratis. It was his misfortune to encounter Burns at a
mason meeting, who, provoked by a long and pedantic speech, from the
Dominie, exclaimed, the future lampoon dawning upon him, &#8220;Sit down,
Dr. Hornbook.&#8221; On his way home, the poet seated himself on the ledge
of a bridge, composed the poem, and, overcome with poesie and drink,
fell asleep, and did not awaken till the sun was shining over Galston
Moors. Wilson went afterwards to Glasgow, embarked in mercantile and
matrimonial speculations, and prospered, and is still prospering.]</p>

<p>[Of this sarcastic and too daring poem many copies in manuscript were
circulated while the poet lived, but though not unknown or unfelt by
Currie, it continued unpublished till printed by Stewart with the
Jolly Beggars, in 1801. Holy Willie was a small farmer, leading elder
to Auld, a name well known to all lovers of Burns; austere in speech,
scrupulous in all outward observances, and, what is known by the name
of a &#8220;professing Christian.&#8221; He experienced, however, a &#8220;sore fall;&#8221;
he permitted himself to be &#8220;filled fou,&#8221; and in a moment when &#8220;self
got in&#8221; made free, it is said, with the money of the poor of the
parish. His name was William Fisher.]</p>

<h3>EPITAPH ON HOLY WILLIE.</h3>
<p>[We are informed by Richmond of Mauchline, that when he was clerk in
Gavin Hamilton&#8217;s office, Burns came in one morning and said, &#8220;I have
just composed a poem, John, and if you will write it, I will repeat
it.&#8221; He repeated Holy Willie&#8217;s Prayer and Epitaph; Hamilton came in at
the moment, and having read them with delight, ran laughing with them
in his hand to Robert Aiken. The end of Holy Willie was other than
godly; in one of his visits to Mauchline, he drank more than was
needful, fell into a ditch on his way home, and was found dead in the
morning.]</p>

<h3>THE INVENTORY;</h3>
<h4>IN ANSWER TO A MANDATE BY THE SURVEYOR
OF THE TAXES.</h4>
<p>[We have heard of a poor play-actor who, by a humorous inventory of
his effects, so moved the commissioners of the income tax, that they
remitted all claim on him then and forever; we know not that this very
humorous inventory of Burns had any such effect on Mr. Aiken, the
surveyor of the taxes. It is dated &#8220;Mossgiel, February 22d, 1786,&#8221; and
is remarkable for wit and sprightliness, and for the information which
it gives us of the poet&#8217;s habits, household, and agricultural
implements.]</p>

<p>[The scene of this fine poem is the church-yard of Mauchline, and the
subject handled so cleverly and sharply is the laxity of manners
visible in matters so solemn and terrible as the administration of the
sacrament. &#8220;This was indeed,&#8221; says Lockhart, &#8220;an extraordinary
performance: no partisan of any sect could whisper that malice had
formed its principal inspiration, or that its chief attraction lay in
the boldness with which individuals, entitled and accustomed to
respect, were held up to ridicule: it was acknowledged, amidst the
sternest mutterings of wrath, that national manners were once more in
the hands of a national poet.&#8221; &#8220;It is no doubt,&#8221; says Hogg, &#8220;a
reckless piece of satire, but it is a clever one, and must have cut to
the bone. But much as I admire the poem I must regret that it is
partly borrowed from Ferguson.&#8221;]</p>

<p>[This sarcastic sally was written on the admission of Mr. Mackinlay,
as one of the ministers to the Laigh, or parochial Kirk of Kilmarnock,
on the 6th of April, 1786. That reverend person was
an Auld Light professor, and his ordination incensed all the New
Lights, hence the bitter levity of the poem. These dissensions have
long since past away: Mackinlay, a pious and kind-hearted sincere man,
lived down all the personalities of the satire, and though unwelcome
at first, he soon learned to regard them only as a proof of the powers
of the poet.]</p>

up as <span class="smcap">Calves</span> of the stall.&#8221;</p>

<p>[The laugh which this little poem raised against Steven was a loud
one. Burns composed it during the sermon to which it relates and
repeated it to Gavin Hamilton, with whom he happened on that day to
dine. The Calf&mdash;for the name it seems stuck&mdash;came to London, where the
younger brother of Burns heard him preach in Covent Garden Chapel, in
1796.]</p>

<p>[The James Smith, to whom this epistle is addressed, was at that time
a small shop-keeper in Mauchline, and the comrade or rather follower of
the poet in all his merry expeditions with &#8220;Yill-caup commentators.&#8221;
He was present in Poosie Nansie&#8217;s when the Jolly Beggars first dawned
on the fancy of Burns: the comrades of the poet&#8217;s heart were not
generally very successful in life: Smith left Mauchline, and
established a calico-printing manufactory at Avon near Linlithgow,
where his friend found him in all appearance prosperous in 1788; but
this was not to last; he failed in his speculations and went to the
West Indies, and died early. His wit was ready, and his manners lively
and unaffected.]</p>

<h3>THE VISION.</h3>
<h4>DUAN FIRST.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></h4>
<p>[The Vision and the Briggs of Ayr, are said by Jeffrey to be &#8220;the only
pieces by Burns which can be classed under the head of pure fiction:&#8221;
but Tam O&#8217; Shanter and twenty other of his compositions have an equal
right to be classed with works of fiction. The edition of this poem
published at Kilmarnock, differs in some particulars from the edition
which followed in Edinburgh. The maiden whose foot was so handsome as
to match that of Coila, was a Bess at first, but old affection
triumphed, and Jean, for whom the honour was from the first designed,
regained her place. The robe of Coila, too, was expanded, so far
indeed that she got more cloth than she could well carry.]</p>

<p>[This Poem contains a lively and striking picture of some of the
superstitious observances of old Scotland: on Halloween the desire to
look into futurity was once all but universal in the north; and the
charms and spells which Burns describes, form but a portion of those
employed to enable the peasantry to have a peep up the dark vista of
the future. The scene is laid on the romantic shores of Ayr, at a
farmer&#8217;s fireside, and the actors in the rustic drama are the whole
household, including supernumerary reapers and bandsmen about to be
discharged from the engagements of harvest. &#8220;I never can help
regarding this,&#8221; says James Hogg, &#8220;as rather a trivial poem!&#8221;]</p>

or plant of kail. They must go out, hand-in-hand, with eyes shut, and
pull the first they meet with: its being big or little, straight or
crooked, is prophetic of the size and shape of the grand object of all
their spells&mdash;the husband or wife. If any yird, or earth, stick to the
root, that is tocher, or fortune; and the taste of the custoc, that
is, the heart of the stem, is indicative of the natural temper and
disposition. Lastly, the stems, or, to give them their ordinary
appellation, the runts, are placed somewhere above the head of the
door; and the Christian names of the people whom chance brings into
the house are, according to the priority of placing the runts, the
names in question.</p></div>

the thread; demand &#8220;wha hauds?&#8221; i.e. who holds? an answer will be

Repeat, now and then, &#8220;Hemp-seed, I saw thee; hemp-seed, I saw thee;
and him (or her) that is to be my true love, come after me and pou
thee.&#8221; Look over your left shoulder, and you will see the appearance
of the person invoked, in the attitude of pulling hemp. Some
traditions say, &#8220;Come after me, and shaw thee,&#8221; that is, show thyself;
in which case it simply appears. Others omit the harrowing, and say,
&#8220;Come after me, and harrow thee.&#8221;</p></div>

alone. You go to the barn, and open both doors, taking them off the
hinges, if possible; for there is danger that the being about to
appear may shut the doors and do you some mischief. Then take that
instrument used in winnowing the corn, which, in our country dialect,
we call a wecht; and go through all the attitudes of letting down corn
against the wind. Repeat it three times; and the third time, an
apparition will pass through the barn, in at the windy door, and out
at the other, having both the figure in question, and the appearance
or retinue marking the employment or station in life.</p></div>

south running spring or rivulet, where &#8220;three lairds&#8217; lands meet,&#8221; and
dip your left shirt-sleeve. Go to bed in sight of a fire, and hang
your wet sleeve before it to dry. Lie awake: and, some time near
midnight, an apparition having the exact figure of the grand object in
question, will come and turn the sleeve, as if to dry the other side
of it.</p></div>

another, and leave the third empty; blindfold a person and lead him to
the hearth where the dishes are ranged; he (or she) dips the left
hand: if by chance in the clean water, the future husband or wife will
come to the bar of matrimony a maid; if in the foul, a widow; if in
the empty dish, it foretells, with equal certainty, no marriage at
all. It is repeated three times, and every time the arrangement of the
dishes is altered.</p></div>

<h3>MAN WAS MADE TO MOURN.</h3>
<h4>A DIRGE.</h4>
<p>[The origin of this fine poem is alluded to by Burns in one of his
letters to Mrs. Dunlop: &#8220;I had an old grand-uncle with whom my mother
lived in her girlish years: the good old man was long blind ere he
died, during which time his highest enjoyment was to sit and cry,
while my mother would sing the simple old song of &#8216;The Life and Age of
Man.&#8217;&#8221; From that truly venerable woman, long after the death of her
distinguished son, Cromek, in collecting the Reliques, obtained a copy
by recitation of the older strain. Though the tone and sentiment
coincide closely with &#8220;Man was made to Mourn,&#8221; I agree with Lockhart,
that Burns wrote it in obedience to his own habitual feelings.]</p>

weakness, and folly! my life reminded me of a ruined temple. What

<p>[This burning commentary, by Burns, on the Essays of Goudie in the
Macgill controversy, was first published by Stewart, with the Jolly
Beggars, in 1801; it is akin in life and spirit to Holy Willie&#8217;s
Prayer; and may be cited as a sample of the wit and the force which
the poet brought to the great, but now forgotten, controversy of the
West.]</p>

<h3>J. LAPRAIK.</h3>
<h4>AN OLD SCOTTISH BARD.</h4>
<p class="std1"><i>April 1st, 1785.</i></p>

<p class="std1">(FIRST EPISTLE.)</p>

<p>[&#8220;The epistle to John Lapraik,&#8221; says Gilbert Burns, &#8220;was produced
exactly on the occasion described by the author. Rocking is a term
derived from primitive times, when our country-women employed their
spare hours in spinning on the roke or distaff. This simple instrument
is a very portable one; and well fitted to the social inclination of
meeting in a neighbour&#8217;s house; hence the phrase of going a rocking,
or with the roke. As the connexion the phrase had with the implement
was forgotten when the roke gave place to the spinning-wheel, the
phrase came to be used by both sexes on social occasions, and men talk
of going with their rokes as well as women.&#8221;]</p>

<p class="std1">(SECOND EPISTLE.)</p>

<p>[The John Lapraik to whom these epistles are addressed lived at
Dalfram in the neighbourhood of Muirkirk, and was a rustic worshipper
of the Muse: he unluckily, however, involved himself in that Western
bubble, the Ayr Bank, and consoled himself by composing in his
distress that song which moved the heart of Burns, beginning</p>

<span class="i0">&#8220;When I upon thy bosom lean.&#8221;<br /></span>

that the inspiration in his song of domestic sorrow was no settled
power of soul.]</p>

<h3>J. LAPRAIK.</h3>
<p class="std1">(THIRD EPISTLE.)</p>

<p>[I have heard one of our most distinguished English poets recite with
a sort of ecstasy some of the verses of these epistles, and praise the
ease of the language and the happiness of the thoughts. He averred,
however, that the poet, when pinched for a word, hesitated not to coin
one, and instanced, &#8220;tapetless,&#8221; &#8220;ramfeezled,&#8221; and &#8220;forjesket,&#8221; as
intrusions in our dialect. These words seem indeed, to some Scotchmen,
strange and uncouth, but they are true words of the west.]</p>

<h3>WILLIAM SIMPSON,</h3>
<h4>OCHILTREE.</h4>
<p>[The person to whom this epistle is addressed, was schoolmaster of
Ochiltree, and afterwards of New Lanark: he was a writer of verses
too, like many more of the poet&#8217;s comrades;&mdash;of verses which rose not
above the barren level of mediocrity: &#8220;one of his poems,&#8221; says
Chambers, &#8220;was a laughable elegy on the death of the Emperor Paul.&#8221; In
his verses to Burns, under the name of a Tailor, there is nothing to
laugh at, though they are intended to be laughable as well as
monitory.]</p>

<h4>ADDRESS</h4>
<h5>TO AN</h5>
<h3>ILLEGITIMATE CHILD.</h3>
<p>[This hasty and not very decorous effusion, was originally entitled
&#8220;The Poet&#8217;s Welcome; or, Rab the Rhymer&#8217;s Address to his Bastard
Child.&#8221; A copy, with the more softened, but less expressive title, was
published by Stewart, in 1801, and is alluded to by Burns himself, in
his biographical letter to Moore. &#8220;Bonnie Betty,&#8221; the mother of the
&#8220;sonsie-smirking, dear-bought Bess,&#8221; of the Inventory, lived in
Largieside: to support this daughter the poet made over the copyright
of his works when he proposed to go to the West Indies. She lived to
be a woman, and to marry one John Bishop, overseer at Polkemmet, where
she died in 1817. It is said she resembled Burns quite as much as any
of the rest of his children.]</p>

<h3>TO THE REV. JOHN M&#8217;MATH.</h3>
<p>[Poor M&#8217;Math was at the period of this epistle assistant to Wodrow,
minister of Tarbolton: he was a good preacher, a moderate man in
matters of discipline, and an intimate of the Coilsfield Montgomerys.
His dependent condition depressed his spirits: he grew dissipated; and
finally, it is said, enlisted as a common soldier, and died in a

<h3>TO A MOUSE,</h3>
<h4>ON TURNING HER UP IN HER NEST WITH THE PLOUGH,</h4>
<h4>NOVEMBER, 1785.</h4>
<p>[This beautiful poem was imagined while the poet was holding the
plough, on the farm of Mossgiel: the field is still pointed out: and a
man called Blane is still living, who says he was gaudsman to the bard
at the time, and chased the mouse with the plough-pettle, for which he
was rebuked by his young master, who inquired what harm the poor mouse
had done him. In the night that followed, Burns awoke his gaudsman,
who was in the same bed with him, recited the poem as it now stands,
and said, &#8220;What think you of our mouse now?&#8221;]</p>

<p class="sig1"><span class="smcap">Parody on Milton</span></p>

<p>[&#8220;This Poem was written,&#8221; says Burns, &#8220;before the act anent the
Scottish distilleries, of session 1786, for which Scotland and the
author return their most grateful thanks.&#8221; Before the passing of this
lenient act, so sharp was the law in the North, that some distillers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
relinquished their trade; the price of barley was affected, and
Scotland, already exasperated at the refusal of a militia, for which
she was a petitioner, began to handle her claymore, and was perhaps
only hindered from drawing it by the act mentioned by the poet. In an
early copy of the poem, he thus alludes to Colonel Hugh Montgomery,
afterwards Earl of Eglinton:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i8">Yere at a stand.&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The poet was not sure that Montgomery would think the compliment to
his ready hand an excuse in full for the allusion to his unready
tongue, and omitted the stanza.]</p>

<p>[&#8220;Burns,&#8221; says Hogg, in a note on this Poem, &#8220;has written more from
his own heart and his own feelings than any other poet. External
nature had few charms for him; the sublime shades and hues of heaven
and earth never excited his enthusiasm: but with the secret fountains
of passion in the human soul he was well acquainted.&#8221; Burns, indeed,
was not what is called a descriptive poet: yet with what exquisite
snatches of description are some of his poems adorned, and in what
fragrant and romantic scenes he enshrines the heroes and heroines of
many of his finest songs! Who the high, exalted, virtuous dames were,
to whom the Poem refers, we are not told. How much men stand indebted
to want of opportunity to sin, and how much of their good name they
owe to the ignorance of the world, were inquiries in which the poet
found pleasure.]</p>

<p>[Tam Samson was a west country seedsman and sportsman, who loved a
good song, a social glass, and relished a shot so well that he
expressed a wish to die and be buried in the moors. On this hint Burns
wrote the Elegy: when Tam heard o&#8217; this he waited on the poet, caused
him to recite it, and expressed displeasure at being numbered with the
dead: the author, whose wit was as ready as his rhymes, added the Per
Contra in a moment, much to the delight of his friend. At his death
the four lines of Epitaph were cut on his gravestone. &#8220;This poem has
always,&#8221; says Hogg, &#8220;been a great country favourite: it abounds with
happy expressions.</p>

<p>What a picture of a flooded burn! any other poet would have given us a
long description: Burns dashes it down at once in a style so graphic
no one can mistake it.</p>

<p>[The hero and heroine of this little mournful poem, were Robert Burns
and Jean Armour. &#8220;This was a most melancholy affair,&#8221; says the poet in
his letter to Moore, &#8220;which I cannot yet bear to reflect on, and had
very nearly given me one or two of the principal qualifications for a
place among those who have lost the chart and mistaken the reckoning
of rationality.&#8221; Hogg and Motherwell, with an ignorance which is
easier to laugh at than account for, say this Poem was &#8220;written on the
occasion of Alexander Cunningham&#8217;s darling sweetheart alighting him
and marrying another:&mdash;she acted a wise part.&#8221; With what care they had
read the great poet whom they jointly edited in is needless to say:
and how they could read the last two lines of the third verse and
commend the lady&#8217;s wisdom for slighting her lover, seems a problem
which defies definition. This mistake was pointed out by a friend, and
corrected in a second issue of the volume.]</p>

<h3>DESPONDENCY.</h3>
<h4>AN ODE.</h4>
<p>[&#8220;I think,&#8221; said Burns, &#8220;it is one of the greatest pleasures attending
a poetic genius, that we can give our woes, cares, joys, and loves an
embodied form in verse, which to me is ever immediate ease.&#8221; He
elsewhere says, &#8220;My passions raged like so many devils till they got
vent in rhyme.&#8221; That eminent painter, Fuseli, on seeing his wife in a
passion, said composedly, &#8220;Swear my love, swear heartily: you know not
how much it will ease you!&#8221; This poem was printed in the Kilmarnock
edition, and gives a true picture of those bitter moments experienced
by the bard, when love and fortune alike deceived him.]</p>

<span class="i0">&#8220;Let not ambition mock their useful toil,<br /></span>

<p>[The house of William Burns was the scene of this fine, devout, and
tranquil drama, and William himself was the saint, the father, and the
husband, who gives life and sentiment to the whole. &#8220;Robert had
frequently remarked to me,&#8221; says Gilbert Burns, &#8220;that he thought there
was something peculiarly venerable in the phrase, &#8216;Let us worship
God!&#8217; used by a decent sober head of a family, introducing family
worship.&#8221; To this sentiment of the author the world is indebted for
the &#8220;Cotter&#8217;s Saturday Night.&#8221; He owed some little, however, of the
inspiration to Fergusson&#8217;s &#8220;Farmer&#8217;s Ingle,&#8221; a poem of great merit.
The calm tone and holy composure of the Cotter&#8217;s Saturday Night have
been mistaken by Hogg for want of nerve and life. &#8220;It is a dull,
heavy, lifeless poem,&#8221; he says, &#8220;and the only beauty it possesses, in
my estimation, is, that it is a sort of family picture of the poet&#8217;s
family. The worst thing of all, it is not original, but is a decided
imitation of Fergusson&#8217;s beautiful pastoral, &#8216;The Farmer&#8217;s Ingle:&#8217; I
have a perfect contempt for all plagiarisms and imitations.&#8221;
Motherwell tries to qualify the censure of his brother editor, by
quoting Lockhart&#8217;s opinion&mdash;at once lofty and just, of this fine
picture of domestic happiness and devotion.]</p>

<h3>THE FIRST PSALM.</h3>
<p>[This version was first printed in the second edition of the poet&#8217;s
work. It cannot be regarded as one of his happiest compositions: it is
inferior, not indeed in ease, but in simplicity and antique rigour of
language, to the common version used in the Kirk of Scotland. Burns
had admitted &#8220;Death and Dr. Hornbook&#8221; into Creech&#8217;s edition, and
probably desired to balance it with something at which the devout
could not cavil.]</p>

<h3>THE FIRST SIX VERSES</h3>
<h5>OF THE</h5>
<h4>NINETIETH PSALM.</h4>
<p>[The ninetieth Psalm is said to have been a favourite in the household
of William Burns: the version used by the Kirk, though unequal,
contains beautiful verses, and possesses the same strain of sentiment
and moral reasoning as the poem of &#8220;Man was made to Mourn.&#8221; These
verses first appeared in the Edinburgh edition; and they might have
been spared; for in the hands of a poet ignorant of the original
language of the Psalmist, how could they be so correct in sense and
expression as in a sacred strain is not only desirable but necessary?]</p>

<h3>TO A MOUNTAIN DAISY,</h3>
<h4>ON TURNING ONE DOWN WITH THE PLOUGH IN</h4>
<h4>APRIL, 1786.</h4>
<p>[This was not the original title of this sweet poem: I have a copy in
the handwriting of Burns entitled &#8220;The Gowan.&#8221; This more natural name
he changed as he did his own, without reasonable cause; and he changed
it about the same time, for he ceased to call himself Burness and his
poem &#8220;The Gowan,&#8221; in the first edition of his works. The field at
Mossgiel where he turned down the Daisy is said to be the same field
where some five months before he turned up the Mouse; but this seems
likely only to those who are little acquainted with tillage&mdash;who think
that in time and place reside the chief charms of verse; and who feel
not the beauty of &#8220;The Daisy,&#8221; till they seek and find the spot on
which it grew. Sublime morality and the deepest emotions of the soul
pass for little with those who remember only what the genius loves to
forget.]</p>

<h3>EPISTLE TO A YOUNG FRIEND.</h3>
<h4>MAY, 1786.</h4>
<p>[Andrew Aikin, to whom this poem of good counsel is addressed, was one
of the sons of Robert Aiken, writer in Ayr, to whom the Cotter&#8217;s
Saturday Night is inscribed. He became a merchant in Liverpool, with
what success we are not informed, and died at St. Petersburgh. The
poet has been charged with a desire to teach hypocrisy rather than
truth to his &#8220;Andrew dear;&#8221; but surely to conceal one&#8217;s own thoughts
and discover those of others, can scarcely be called hypocritical: it
is, in fact, a version of the celebrated precept of prudence,
&#8220;Thoughts close and looks loose.&#8221; Whether he profited by all the
counsel showered upon him by the muse we know not: he was much
respected&mdash;his name embalmed, like that of his father, in the poetry
of his friend, is not likely soon to perish.]</p>

<h3>TO A LOUSE,</h3>
<h5>ON SEEING ONE IN A LADY&#8217;S BONNET, AT CHURCH</h5>
<p>[A Mauchline incident of a Mauchline lady is related in this poem,
which to many of the softer friends of the bard was anything but
welcome: it appeared in the Kilmarnock copy of his Poems, and
remonstrance and persuasion were alike tried in vain to keep it out of
the Edinburgh edition. Instead of regarding it as a seasonable rebuke
to pride and vanity, some of his learned commentators called it course
and vulgar&mdash;those classic persons might have remembered that Julian,
no vulgar person, but an emperor and a scholar, wore a populous beard,
and was proud of it.]</p>

<h3>EPISTLE TO J. RANKINE,</h3>
<h5>ENCLOSING SOME POEMS.</h5>
<p>[The person to whom these verses are addressed lived at Adamhill in
Ayrshire, and merited the praise of rough and ready-witted, which the
poem bestows. The humorous dream alluded to, was related by way of
rebuke to a west country earl, who was in the habit of calling all
people of low degree &#8220;Brutes!&mdash;damned brutes.&#8221; &#8220;I dreamed that I was
dead,&#8221; said the rustic satirist to his superior, &#8220;and condemned for
the company I kept. When I came to hell-door, where mony of your
lordship&#8217;s friends gang, I chappit, and &#8216;Wha are ye, and where d&#8217;ye
come frae?&#8217; Satan exclaimed. I just said, that my name was Rankine,
and I came frae yere lordship&#8217;s land. &#8216;Awa wi&#8217; you,&#8217; cried Satan, ye
canna come here: hell&#8217;s fou o&#8217; his lordship&#8217;s damned brutes

<h3>ON A SCOTCH BARD,</h3>
<h5>GONE TO THE WEST INDIES.</h5>
<p>[Burns in this Poem, as well as in others, speaks openly of his tastes
and passions: his own fortunes are dwelt on with painful minuteness,
and his errors are recorded with the accuracy, but not the seriousness
of the confessional. He seems to have been fond of taking himself to
task. It was written when &#8220;Hungry ruin had him in the wind,&#8221; and
emigration to the West Indies was the only refuge which he could think
of, or his friends suggest, from the persecutions of fortune.]</p>

Scottish bard, are not permitted to mingle, Burns bids farewell to all

<h4>A DEDICATION</h4>
<h5>TO</h5>
<h3>GAVIN HAMILTON, ESQ.</h3>
<p>[The gentleman to whom these manly lines are addressed, was of good
birth, and of an open and generous nature: he was one of the first of
the gentry of the west to encourage the muse of Coila to stretch her
wings at full length. His free life, and free speech, exposed him to
the censures of that stern divine, Daddie Auld, who charged him with
the sin of absenting himself from church for three successive days;
for having, without the fear of God&#8217;s servant before him, profanely
said damn it, in his presence, and far having gallopped on Sunday.
These charges were contemptuously dismissed by the presbyterial court.
Hamilton was the brother of the Charlotte to whose charms, on the
banks of Devon, Burns, it is said, paid the homage of a lover, as well
as of a poet. The poem had a place in the Kilmarnock edition, but not
as an express dedication.]</p>

<h3>WILLIE CHALMERS.</h3>
<p>[Lockhart first gave this poetic curiosity to the world: he copied it
from a small manuscript volume of Poems given by Burns to Lady Harriet
Don, with an explanation in these words: &#8220;W. Chalmers, a gentleman in
Ayrshire, a particular friend of mine, asked me to write a poetic
epistle to a young lady, his Dulcinea. I had seen her, but was
scarcely acquainted with her, and wrote as follows.&#8221; Chalmers was a
writer in Ayr. I have not heard that the lady was influenced by this
volunteer effusion: ladies are seldom rhymed into the matrimonial
snare.]</p>

THE AUTHOR LEFT THE FOLLOWING</h5>
<h3>VERSES</h3>
<h5>IN THE ROOM WHERE HE SLEPT.</h5>
<p>[Of the origin of those verses Gilbert Burns gives the following
account. &#8220;The first time Robert heard the spinet played was at the
house of Dr. Lawrie, then minister of Loudon, now in
Glasgow. Dr. Lawrie has several daughters; one of them played; the
father and the mother led down the dance; the rest of the sisters, the
brother, the poet and the other guests mixed in it. It was a
delightful family scene for our poet, then lately introduced to the
world; his mind was roused to a poetic enthusiasm, and the stanzas
were left in the room where he slept.&#8221;]</p>

Tootie whose skill he records, lived in Mauchline, and dealt in cows:
he was an artful and contriving person, great in bargaining and
intimate with all the professional tricks by which old cows are made
to look young, and six-pint hawkies pass for those of twelve.]</p>

<h3>ANSWER TO A POETICAL EPISTLE</h3>
<h5>SENT TO THE AUTHOR BY A TAILOR.</h5>
<p>[The person who in the name of a Tailor took the liberty of
admonishing Burns about his errors, is generally believed to have been
William Simpson, the schoolmaster of Ochiltree: the verses seem about
the measure of his capacity, and were attributed at the time to his
hand. The natural poet took advantage of the mask in which the made
poet concealed himself, and rained such a merciless storm upon him, as
would have extinguished half the Tailors in Ayrshire, and made the
amazed dominie</p>

<p>[The bank-note on which these characteristic lines were endorsed, came
into the hands of the late James Gracie, banker in Dumfries: he knew
the handwriting of Burns, and kept it as a curiosity. The concluding

<p>On reading, in the public papers, the &#8220;Laureate&#8217;s Ode,&#8221; with the other
parade of June 4th, 1786, the author was no sooner dropt asleep, than
he imagined himself transported to the birth-day levee; and, in his
dreaming fancy, made the following &#8220;Address.&#8221;</p>

<p>[The prudent friends of the poet remonstrated with him about this
Poem, which they appeared to think would injure his fortunes and stop
the royal bounty to which he was thought entitled. Mrs. Dunlop, and
Mrs. Stewart, of Stair, solicited him in vain to omit it in the
Edinburgh edition of his poems. I know of no poem for which a claim of
being prophetic would be so successfully set up: it is full of point
as well as of the future. The allusions require no comment.]</p>

of his own course? Here is a sincere and solemn avowal&mdash;a confession

<h3>THE TWA DOGS.</h3>
<h5>A TALE.</h5>
<p>[Cromek, an anxious and curious inquirer, informed me, that the Twa
Dogs was in a half-finished state, when the poet consulted John
Wilson, the printer, about the Kilmarnock edition. On looking over the
manuscripts, the printer, with a sagacity common to his profession,
said, &#8220;The Address to the Deil&#8221; and &#8220;The Holy Fair&#8221; were grand things,
but it would be as well to have a calmer and sedater strain, to put at
the front of the volume. Burns was struck with the remark, and on his
way home to Mossgiel, completed the Poem, and took it next day to
Kilmarnock, much to the satisfaction of &#8220;Wee Johnnie.&#8221; On the 17th
February Burns says to John Richmond, of Mauchline, &#8220;I have completed
my Poem of the Twa Dogs, but have not shown it to the world.&#8221; It is
difficult to fix the dates with anything like accuracy, to
compositions which are not struck off at one heat of the fancy. &#8220;Luath

says Gilbert Burns; &#8220;but C&aelig;sar was merely the creature of the
imagination.&#8221; The Ettrick Shepherd, a judge of collies, says that
Luath is true to the life, and that many a hundred times he has seen
the dogs bark for very joy, when the cottage children were merry.]</p>

<h5>ON</h5>
<h4>MEETING WITH LORD DAER.</h4>
<p>[&#8220;The first time I saw Robert Burns,&#8221; says Dugald Stewart, &#8220;was on the
23rd of October, 1786, when he dined at my house in Ayrshire, together
with our common friend, John Mackenzie, surgeon in Mauchline, to whom
I am indebted for the pleasure of his acquaintance. My excellent and
much-lamented friend, the late Basil, Lord Daer, happened to arrive at
Catrine the same day, and, by the kindness and frankness of his
manners, left an impression on the mind of the poet which was never
effaced. The verses which the poet wrote on the occasion are among the
most imperfect of his pieces, but a few stanzas may perhaps be a
matter of curiosity, both on account of the character to which they
relate and the light which they throw on the situation and the
feelings of the writer before his work was known to the public.&#8221;
Basil, Lord Daer, the uncle of the present Earl of Selkirk, was born
in the year 1769, at the family seat of St.
Mary&#8217;s Isle: he distinguished himself early at school, and at college
excelled in literature and science; he had a greater regard for
democracy than was then reckoned consistent with his birth and rank.
He was, when Burns met him, in his twenty-third year; was very tall,
something careless in his dress, and had the taste and talent common
to his distinguished family. He died in his thirty-third year.]</p>

<h3>ADDRESS TO EDINBURGH.</h3>
<p>[&#8220;I enclose you two poems,&#8221; said Burns to his friend Chalmers, &#8220;which
I have carded and spun since I passed Glenbuck. One blank in the
Address to Edinburgh, &#8216;Fair B&mdash;&mdash;,&#8217; is the heavenly Miss Burnet,
daughter to Lord Monboddo, at whose house I have had the honour to be
more than once. There has not been anything nearly like her, in all
the combinations of beauty, grace, and goodness the great Creator has
formed, since Milton&#8217;s Eve, on the first day of her existence.&#8221; Lord
Monboddo made himself ridiculous by his speculations on human nature,
and acceptable by his kindly manners and suppers in the manner of the
ancients, where his viands were spread under ambrosial lights, and his
Falernian was wreathed with flowers. At these suppers Burns sometimes
made his appearance. The &#8220;Address&#8221; was first printed in the Edinburgh
edition: the poet&#8217;s hopes were then high, and his compliments, both to
town and people, were elegant and happy.]</p>

<h3>EPISTLE TO MAJOR LOGAN.</h3>
<p>[Major Logan, of Camlarg, lived, when this hasty Poem was written,
with his mother and sister at Parkhouse, near Ayr. He was a good
musician, a joyous companion, and something of a wit. The Epistle was
printed, for the first time, in my edition of Burns, in 1834, and
since then no other edition has wanted it.]</p>

<h3>THE BRIGS OF AYR,</h3>
<h4>A POEM,</h4>
<h5>INSCRIBED TO J. BALLANTYNE, ESQ., AYR.</h5>
<p>[Burns took the hint of this Poem from the Planestanes and Causeway of
Fergusson, but all that lends it life and feeling belongs to his own
heart and his native Ayr: he wrote it for the second edition of his
poems, and in compliment to the patrons of his genius in the west.
Ballantyne, to whom the Poem is inscribed, was generous when the
distresses of his farming speculations pressed upon him: others of his
friends figure in the scene: Montgomery&#8217;s courage, the learning of
Dugald Stewart, and condescension and kindness of Mrs. General
Stewart, of Stair, are gratefully recorded.]</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The simple Bard, rough at the rustic plough,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Learning his tuneful trade from ev&#8217;ry bough;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The chanting linnet, or the mellow thrush,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hailing the setting sun, sweet, in the green thorn bush:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The soaring lark, the perching red-breast shrill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or deep-ton&#8217;d plovers, gray, wild-whistling o&#8217;er the hill;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall he, nurst in the peasant&#8217;s lowly shed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To hardy independence bravely bred,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By early poverty to hardship steel&#8217;d,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And train&#8217;d to arms in stern misfortune&#8217;s field&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall he be guilty of their hireling crimes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The servile, mercenary Swiss of rhymes?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or labour hard the panegyric close,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With all the venal soul of dedicating prose?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No! though his artless strains he rudely sings,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And throws his hand uncouthly o&#8217;er the strings,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He glows with all the spirit of the Bard,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fame, honest fame, his great, his dear reward!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still, if some patron&#8217;s gen&#8217;rous care he trace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Skill&#8217;d in the secret to bestow with grace;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When Ballantyne befriends his humble name,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hands the rustic stranger up to fame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With heart-felt throes his grateful bosom swells,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The godlike bliss, to give, alone excels.<br /></span>

<h4>ON</h4>
<h3>THE DEATH OF ROBERT DUNDAS, ESQ.,</h3>
<h4>OF ARNISTON,</h4>
<h5>LATE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COURT OF SESSION.</h5>
<p>[At the request of Advocate Hay, Burns composed this Poem, in the hope
that it might interest the powerful family of Dundas in his fortunes.
I found it inserted in the handwriting of the poet, in an interleaved
copy of his Poems, which he presented to Dr. Geddes, accompanied by
the following surly note:&mdash;&#8220;The foregoing Poem has some tolerable
lines in it, but the incurable wound of my pride will not suffer me to
correct, or even peruse it. I sent a copy of it with my best prose
letter to the son of the great man, the theme of the piece, by the
hands of one of the noblest men in God&#8217;s world, Alexander Wood,
surgeon: when, behold! his solicitorship took no more notice of my
Poem, or of me, than I had been a strolling fiddler who had made free
with his lady&#8217;s name, for a silly new reel. Did the fellow imagine
that I looked for any dirty gratuity?&#8221; This Robert Dundas was the
elder brother of that Lord Melville to whose hands, soon after these
lines were written, all the government patronage in Scotland was
confided, and who, when the name of Burns was mentioned, pushed the
wine to Pitt, and said nothing. The poem was first printed by me, in
1834.]</p>

<h3>THE DEATH OF JOHN M&#8217;LEOD, ESQ.</h3>
<h5>BROTHER TO A YOUNG LADY, A PARTICULAR FRIEND

  OF THE AUTHOR&#8217;S.</h5>
<p>[John M&#8217;Leod was of the ancient family of Raza, and brother to that
Isabella M&#8217;Leod, for whom Burns, in his correspondence, expressed
great regard. The little <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>Poem, when first printed, consisted of six
verses: I found a seventh in M&#8217;Murdo Manuscripts, the fifth in this
edition, along with an intimation in prose, that the M&#8217;Leod family had
endured many unmerited misfortunes. I observe that Sir Harris Nicolas
has rejected this new verse, because, he says, it repeats the same
sentiment as the one which precedes it. I think differently, and have
retained it.]</p>

<h5>JAN. 1, 1787.</h5>
<p>[Burns was fond of writing compliments in books, and giving them in
presents among his fair friends. Miss Logan, of Park house, was sister
to Major Logan, of Camlarg, and the &#8220;sentimental sister Susie,&#8221; of the
Epistle to her brother. Both these names were early dropped out of the

<h3>THE AMERICAN WAR.</h3>
<h5>A FRAGMENT.</h5>
<p>[Dr. Blair said that the politics of Burns smelt of the smithy, which,
interpreted, means, that they were unstatesman-like, and worthy of a
country ale-house, and an audience of peasants. The Poem gives us a
striking picture of the humorous and familiar way in which the hinds
and husbandmen of Scotland handle national topics: the smithy is a
favourite resort, during the winter evenings, of rustic politicians;
and national affairs and parish scandal are alike discussed. Burns was
in those days, and some time after, a vehement Tory: his admiration of
&#8220;Chatham&#8217;s Boy,&#8221; called down on him the dusty indignation of the
republican Ritson.]</p>

<h3>THE DEAN OF FACULTY.</h3>
<h4>A NEW BALLAD.</h4>
<p>[The Hal and Bob of these satiric lines were Henry Erskine, and Robert
Dundas: and their contention was, as the verses intimate, for the
place of Dean of the Faculty of Advocates: Erskine was successful. It
is supposed that in characterizing Dundas, the poet remembered &#8220;the
incurable wound which his pride had got&#8221; in the affair of the elegiac
verses on the death of the elder Dundas. The poem first appeared in

sentimental and platonic flirtation with the poet, contained in the
well-known letters to Clarinda. The letters, after the poet&#8217;s death,
appeared in print without her permission: she obtained an injunction
against the publication, which still remains in force, but her anger
seems to have been less a matter of taste than of whim, for the
injunction has been allowed to slumber in the case of some editors,
though it has been enforced against others.]</p>

<h3>SKETCH.</h3>
<p>[This Sketch is a portion of a long Poem which Burns proposed to call
&#8220;The Poet&#8217;s Progress.&#8221; He communicated the little he had done, for he
was a courter of opinions, to Dugald Stewart. &#8220;The Fragment forms,&#8221;
said he, &#8220;the postulata, the axioms, the definition of a character,
which, if it appear at all, shall be placed in a variety of lights.
This particular part I send you, merely as a sample of my hand at
portrait-sketching.&#8221; It is probable that the professor&#8217;s response was
not favourable for we hear no more of the Poem.]</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p>[The lady to whom this epistle is addressed was a painter and a
poetess: her pencil sketches are said to have been beautiful; and she
had a ready skill in rhyme, as the verses addressed to Burns fully

Mrs. Cockburn, authoress of a beautiful variation of The Flowers of
the Forest.]</p>

<h3>EPISTLE TO WILLIAM CREECH.</h3>
<p>[A storm of rain detained Burns one day, during his border tour, at
Selkirk, and he employed his time in writing this characteristic
epistle to Creech, his bookseller. Creech was a person of education
and taste; he was not only the most popular publisher in the north,
but he was intimate with almost all the distinguished men who, in
those days, adorned Scottish literature. But though a joyous man, a
lover of sociality, and the keeper of a good table, he was close and
parsimonious, and loved to hold money to the last moment that the law
allowed.]</p>

<h5>THE</h5>
<h3>HUMBLE PETITION OF BRUAR WATER</h3>
<h5>TO THE</h5>
<h4>NOBLE DUKE OF ATHOLE.</h4>
<p>[The Falls of Bruar in Athole are exceedingly beautiful and
picturesque; and their effect, when Burns visited them, was much
impaired by want of shrubs and trees. This was in 1787: the poet,
accompanied by his future biographer, Professor Walker, went, when
close on twilight, to this romantic scene: &#8220;he threw himself,&#8221; said
the Professor, &#8220;on a heathy seat, and gave himself up to a tender,
abstracted, and voluptuous enthusiasm of imagination. In a few days I
received a letter from Inverness, for the poet had gone on his way,
with the Petition enclosed.&#8221; His Grace of Athole obeyed the
injunction: the picturesque points are now crowned with thriving
woods, and the beauty of the Falls is much increased.]</p>

of the water is about two hundred feet. There is another fall further

<h4>WRITTEN IN</h4>
<h3>FRIARS-CARSE HERMITAGE,</h3>
<h4>ON NITHSIDE.</h4>
<h5>DECEMBER, 1788.</h5>
<p>[Of this Poem Burns thought so well that he gave away many copies in
his own handwriting: I have seen three. When corrected to his mind,
and the manuscripts showed many changes and corrections, he published
it in the new edition of his Poems as it stands in this second copy.
The little Hermitage where these lines were written, stood in a lonely
plantation belonging to the estate of Friars-Carse, and close to the
march-dyke of Ellisland; a small door in the fence, of which the poet
had the key, admitted him at pleasure, and there he found seclusion
such as he liked, with flowers and shrubs all around him. The first
twelve lines of the Poem were engraved neatly on one of the
window-panes, by the diamond pencil of the Bard. On Riddel&#8217;s death,
the Hermitage was allowed to go quietly to decay: I remember in 1803
turning two outlyer stots out of the interior.]</p>

qualified himself; and as he began to dread that farming would be
unprofitable, he wrote to remind his patron of his promise, and
requested to be appointed to a division in his own neighbourhood. He
was appointed in due time: his division was extensive, and included
ten parishes.]</p>

<h4>ON THE DEATH OF</h4>
<h3>SIR JAMES HUNTER BLAIR.</h3>
<p>[I found these lines written with a pencil in one of Burns&#8217;s
memorandum-books: he said he had just composed them, and pencilled
them down lest they should escape from his memory. They differed in
nothing from the printed copy of the first Liverpool edition. That
they are by Burns there cannot be a doubt, though they were, I know
not for what reason, excluded from several editions of the Posthumous
Works of the poet.]</p>

<h3>A NOBLE EARL&#8217;S PICTURE.</h3>
<p>[Burns placed the portraits of Dr. Blacklock and the Earl of
Glencairn, over his parlour chimney-piece at Ellisland: beneath the
head of the latter he wrote some verses, which he sent to the Earl,
and requested leave to make public. This seems to have been refused;
and, as the verses were lost for years, it was believed they were
destroyed: a rough copy, however, is preserved, and is now in the safe
keeping of the Earl&#8217;s name-son, Major James Glencairn Burns. James
Cunningham, Earl of Glencairn, died 20th January, 1791, aged 42 years;
he was succeeded by his only and childless brother, with whom this
ancient race was closed.]</p>

<h3>ODE</h3>
<h4>SACRED TO THE MEMORY OF</h4>
<h3>MRS. OSWALD,</h3>
<h5>OF AUCHENCRUIVE.</h5>
<p>[The origin of this harsh effusion shows under what feelings Burns
sometimes wrote. He was, he says, on his way to Ayrshire, one stormy
day in January, and had made himself comfortable, in spite of the
snow-drift, over a smoking bowl, at an inn at the Sanquhar, when in
wheeled the whole funeral pageantry of Mrs. Oswald. He was obliged to
mount his horse and ride for quarters to New Cumnock, where, over a
good fire, he penned, in his very ungallant indignation, the Ode to
the lady&#8217;s memory. He lived to think better of the name.]</p>

<h4>FRAGMENT INSCRIBED</h4>
<h3>TO THE RIGHT HON. C.J. FOX.</h3>
<p>[It was late in life before Burns began to think very highly of Fox:
he had hitherto spoken of him rather as a rattler of dice, and a
frequenter of soft company, than as a statesman. As his hopes from the
Tories vanished,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span> he began to think of the Whigs: the first did
nothing, and the latter held out hopes; and as hope, he said was the
cordial of the human heart, he continued to hope on.]</p>

<h4>ON SEEING</h4>
<h3>A WOUNDED HARE</h3>
<h4>LIMP BY ME,</h4>
<h5>WHICH A FELLOW HAD JUST SHOT.</h5>
<p>[This Poem is founded on fact. A young man of the name of Thomson told
me&mdash;quite unconscious of the existence of the Poem&mdash;that while Burns
lived at Ellisland&mdash;he shot at and hurt a hare, which in the twilight
was feeding on his father&#8217;s wheat-bread. The poet, on observing the
hare come bleeding past him, &#8220;was in great wrath,&#8221; said Thomson, &#8220;and
cursed me, and said little hindered him from throwing me into the
Nith; and he was able enough to do it, though I was both young and
strong.&#8221; The boor of Nithside did not use the hare worse than the
critical Dr. Gregory, of Edinburgh, used the Poem: when Burns read his
remarks he said, &#8220;Gregory is a good man, but he crucifies me!&#8221;]</p>

<p>[This blind scholar, though an indifferent Poet, was an excellent and
generous man: he was foremost of the Edinburgh literati to admire the
Poems of Burns, promote their fame, and advise that the author,
instead of shipping himself for Jamaica, should come to Edinburgh and

Blacklock to the last hour of his life.&mdash;Henry Mackenzie, the Earl of

<h3>PROLOGUE,</h3>
<h4>SPOKEN AT THE THEATRE, DUMFRIES,</h4>
<h5>1 JAN. 1790.</h5>
<p>[This prologue was written in December, 1789, for Mr. Sutherland, who
recited it with applause in the little theatre of Dumfries, on
new-year&#8217;s night. Sir Harris Nicolas, however, has given to Ellisland
the benefit of a theatre! and to Burns the whole barony of Dalswinton
for a farm!]</p>

<h4>DUMFRIES.</h4>
<p>[Burns did not shine in prologues: he produced some vigorous lines,
but they did not come in harmony from his tongue, like the songs in
which he recorded the loveliness of the dames of Caledonia. Sutherland
was manager of the theatre, and a writer of rhymes.&mdash;Burns said his
players were a very decent set: he had seen them an evening or two.]</p>

<p>[This is a picture of the Dunlop family: it was printed from a hasty
sketch, which the poet called extempore. The major whom it mentions,
was General Andrew Dunlop, who died in 1804: Rachel Dunlop was
afterwards married to Robert Glasgow, Esq. Another of the Dunlops
served with distinction in India, where he rose to the rank of
General. They were a gallant race, and all distinguished.]</p>

<h5>A SATIRE.</h5>
<p class="std1">[FIRST VERSION.]</p>

<p>[The history of this Poem is curious. M&#8217;Gill, one of the ministers of
Ayr, long suspected of entertaining heterodox opinions concerning
original sin and the Trinity, published &#8220;A Practical Essay on the
Death of Jesus Christ,&#8221; which, in the opinion of the more rigid
portion of his brethren, inclined both to Arianism and Socinianism.
This essay was denounced as heretical, by a minister of the name
Peebles, in a sermon preached November 5th, 1788, and all the west
country was in a flame. The subject was brought before the Synod, and
was warmly debated till M&#8217;Gill expressed his regret for the disquiet
he had occasioned, explained away or apologized for the challenged
passages in his Essay, and declared his adherence to the Standard
doctrines of his mother church. Burns was prevailed upon to bring his
satire to the aid of M&#8217;Gill, but he appears to have done so with
reluctance.]</p>

<h3>THE KIRK&#8217;S ALARM.</h3>
<h5>A BALLAD.</h5>
<p class="std1">[SECOND VERSION.]</p>

<p>[This version is from the papers of Miss Logan, of Afton. The origin
of the Poem is thus related to Graham of Fintry by the poet himself:
&#8220;Though I dare say you have none of the solemn League and Covenant
fire Which shone so conspicuous in Lord George Gordon, and the
Kilmarnock weavers, yet I think you must have heard of Dr. M&#8217;Gill, one
of the clergymen of Ayr, and his heretical book, God help him, poor
man! Though one of the worthiest, as well as one of the ablest of the
whole priesthood of the Kirk of Scotland, in every sense of that
ambiguous term, yet the poor doctor and his numerous family are in
imminent danger of being thrown out (9th December, 1790) to the mercy
of the winter winds. The enclosed ballad on that business, is, I
confess too local: but I laughed myself at some conceits in it, though
I am convinced in my conscience there are a good many heavy stanzas in
it too.&#8221; The Kirk&#8217;s Alarm was first printed by Stewart, in 1801.
Cromek calls it, &#8220;A silly satire, on some worthy ministers of the
gospel, in Ayrshire.&#8221;]</p>

<p>[These hasty verses are to be found in a letter addressed to Nicol, of
the High School of Edinburgh, by the poet, giving him on account of
the unlooked-for death of his mare, Peg Nicholson, the successor of
Jenny Geddes. She had suffered both in the employ of the joyous priest
and the thoughtless poet. She acquired her name from that frantic
virago who attempted to murder George the Third.]</p>

<p>[Captain Matthew Henderson, a gentleman of very agreeable manners and
great propriety of character, usually lived in Edinburgh, dined
constantly at Fortune&#8217;s Tavern, and was a member of the Capillaire
Club, which was composed of all who desired to be thought witty or
joyous: he died in 1789: Burns, in a note to the Poem, says, &#8220;I loved
the man much, and have not flattered his memory.&#8221; Henderson seems
indeed to have been universally liked. &#8220;In our travelling party,&#8221; says
Sir James Campbell, of Ardkinglass, &#8220;was Matthew Henderson, then
(1759) and afterwards well known and much esteemed in the town of
Edinburgh; at that time an officer in the twenty-fifth regiment of
foot, and like myself on his way to join the army; and I may say with
truth, that in the course of a long life I have never known a more
estimable character, than Matthew Henderson.&#8221; <i>Memoirs of Campbell, of
Ardkinglass</i>, p. 17.]</p>

<h3>THE FIVE CARLINS.</h3>
<h4>A SCOTS BALLAD.</h4>
<h5>Tune&mdash;<i>Chevy Chase.</i></h5>
<p>[This is a local and political Poem composed on the contest between
Miller, the younger, of Dalswinton, and Johnstone, of Westerhall, for
the representation of the Dumfries and Galloway district of Boroughs.
Each town or borough speaks and acts in character: Maggy personates
Dumfries; Marjory, Lochmaben; Bess of Solway-side, Annan; Whiskey Jean,
Kirkcudbright; and Black Joan, Sanquhar. On the part of Miller, all
the Whig interest of the Duke of Queensberry was exerted, and all the
Tory interest on the side of the Johnstone: the poet&#8217;s heart was with
the latter. Annan and Lochmaben stood staunch by old names and old
affections: after a contest, bitterer than anything of the kind
remembered, the Whig interest prevailed.]</p>

<h5>ON THE CLOSE OF THE DISPUTED ELECTION BETWEEN</h5>
<h5>SIR JAMES JOHNSTONE AND CAPTAIN MILLER, FOR</h5>
<h5>THE DUMFRIES DISTRICT OF BOROUGHS.</h5>
<p>[&#8220;I am too little a man,&#8221; said Burns, in the note to Fintray, which
accompanied this poem, &#8220;to have any political attachment: I am deeply
indebted to, and have the warmest veneration for individuals of both
parties: but a man who has it in his power to be the father of a
country, and who acts like his Grace of Queensberry, is a character
that one cannot speak of with patience.&#8221; This Epistle was first
printed in my edition of Burns in 1834: I had the use of the Macmurdo
and the Afton manuscripts for that purpose: to both families the poet
was much indebted for many acts of courtesy and kindness.]</p>

<h4>ANTIQUITIES OF THAT KINGDOM.</h4>
<p>[This &#8220;fine, fat, fodgel wight&#8221; was a clever man, a skilful antiquary,
and fond of wit and wine. He was well acquainted with heraldry, and
was conversant with the weapons and the armor of his own and other
countries. He found his way to Friars-Carse, in the Vale of Nith, and
there, at the social &#8220;board of Glenriddel,&#8221; for the first time saw
Burns. The Englishman heard, it is said, with wonder, the sarcastic
sallies and eloquent bursts of the inspired Scot, who, in his turn,
surveyed with wonder the remarkable corpulence, and listened with
pleasure to the independent sentiments and humourous turns of
conversation in the joyous Englishman. This Poem was the fruit of the
interview, and it is said that Grose regarded some passages as rather
personal.]</p>

<h4>WRITTEN IN A WRAPPER,</h4>
<h5>ENCLOSING</h5>
<h3>A LETTER TO CAPTAIN GROSE.</h3>
<p>[Burns wrote out some antiquarian and legendary memoranda, respecting
certain ruins in Kyle, and enclosed them in a sheet of a paper to
Cardonnel, a northern antiquary. As his mind teemed with poetry he
could not, as he afterwards said, let the opportunity, pass of sending
a rhyming inquiry after his fat friend, and Cardonnel spread the
condoling inquiry over the North&mdash;</p>

<p>[This is a West-country legend, embellished by genius. No other Poem
in our language displays such variety of power, in the same number of
lines. It was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span> written as an inducement to Grose to admit Alloway-Kirk
into his work on the Antiquities of Scotland; and written with such
ecstasy, that the poet shed tears in the moments of composition. The
walk in which it was conceived, on the braes of Ellisland, is held in
remembrance in the vale, and pointed out to poetic inquirers: while
the scene where the poem is laid&mdash;the crumbling ruins&mdash;the place where
the chapman perished in the snow&mdash;the tree on which the poor mother of
Mungo ended her sorrows&mdash;the cairn where the murdered child was found
by the hunters&mdash;and the old bridge over which Maggie bore her
astonished master when all hell was in pursuit, are first-rate objects
of inspection and inquiry in the &#8220;Land of Burns.&#8221; &#8220;In the inimitable
tale of Tam o&#8217; Shanter,&#8221; says Scott &#8220;Burns has left us sufficient
evidence of his ability to combine the ludicrous with the awful, and
even the horrible. No poet, with the exception of Shakspeare, ever
possessed the power of exciting the most varied and discordant
emotions with such rapid transitions.&#8221;]</p>

<h3>ADDRESS OF BEELZEBUB</h3>
<h5>TO THE</h5>
<h4>PRESIDENT OF THE HIGHLAND SOCIETY.</h4>
<p>[This Poem made its first appearance, as I was assured by my friend
the late Thomas Pringle, in the Scots Magazine, for February, 1818,
and was printed from the original in the handwriting of Burns. It was
headed thus, &#8220;To the Right honorable the Earl of Brendalbyne,
President of the Right Honourable and Honourable the Highland Society,
which met on the 23d of May last, at the Shakspeare, Covent Garden, to
concert ways and means to frustrate the designs of four hundred
Highlanders, who, as the Society were informed by Mr. M. &mdash;&mdash;, of A&mdash;&mdash;s, were so audacious as to attempt an escape from their lawful lairds
and masters, whose property they were, by emigrating from the lands of
Mr. Macdonald, of Glengarry, to the wilds of Canada, in search of that
fantastic thing&mdash;<span class="smcap">Liberty</span>.&#8221; The Poem was communicated by Burns
to his friend Rankine of Adam Hill, in Ayrshire.]</p>

<h3>JOHN TAYLOR.</h3>
<p>[Burns, it appears, was, in one of his excursions in revenue matters,
likely to be detained at Wanlockhead: the roads were slippery with
ice, his mare kept her feet with difficulty, and all the blacksmiths
of the village were pre-engaged. To Mr. Taylor, a person of influence
in the place, the poet, in despair, addressed this little Poem,
begging his interference: Taylor spoke to a smith; the smith flew to
his tools, sharpened or frosted the shoes, and it is said lived for
thirty years to boast that he had &#8220;never been well paid but ance, and
that was by a poet, who paid him in money, paid him in drink, and paid
him in verse.&#8221;]</p>

<h4>LAMENT</h4>
<h5>OF</h5>
<h3>MARY, QUEEN OF SCOTS,</h3>
<h5>ON THE APPROACH OF SPRING.</h5>
<p>[The poet communicated this &#8220;Lament&#8221; to his friend, Dr. Moore, in
February, 1791, but it was composed about the close of the preceding
year, at the request of Lady Winifred Maxwell Constable, of
Terreagles, the last in direct descent of the noble and ancient house
of Maxwell, of Nithsdale. Burns expressed himself more than commonly
pleased with this composition; nor was he unrewarded, for Lady
Winifred gave him a valuable snuff-box, with the portrait of the
unfortunate Mary on the lid. The bed still keeps its place in
Terreagles, on which the queen slept as she was on her way to take
refuge with her cruel and treacherous cousin, Elizabeth; and a letter
from her no less unfortunate grandson, Charles the First, calling the
Maxwells to arm in his cause, is preserved in the family archives.]</p>

<h3>THE WHISTLE.</h3>
<p>[&#8220;As the authentic prose history,&#8221; says Burns, &#8220;of the &#8216;Whistle&#8217; is
curious, I shall here give it. In the train of Anne of Denmark, when
she came to Scotland with our James the Sixth, there came over also a
Danish gentleman of gigantic stature and great prowess, and a
matchless champion of Bacchus. He had a little ebony whistle, which at
the commencement of the orgies, he laid on the table, and whoever was
the last able to blow it, everybody else being disabled by the potency
of the bottle, was to carry off the whistle as a trophy of victory.
The Dane produced credentials of his victories, without a single
defeat, at the courts of Copenhagen, Stockholm, Moscow, Warsaw, and
several of the petty courts in Germany; and challenged the Scotch
Bacchanalians to the alternative of trying his prowess, or else of
acknowledging their inferiority. After man overthrows on the part of
the Scots, the Dane was encountered by Sir Robert Lawrie, of
Maxwelton, ancestor of the present worthy baronet of that name; who,
after three days and three nights&#8217; hard contest, left the Scandinavian
under the table,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8216;And blew on the whistle his requiem shrill.&#8217;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>&#8220;Sir Walter, son to Sir Robert before mentioned, afterwards lost the
whistle to Walter Riddel, of Glenriddel, who had married a sister of
Sir Walter&#8217;s.&mdash;On Friday, the 16th of October, 1790, at Friars-Carse,
the whistle was once more contended for, as related in the ballad, by
the present Sir Robert of Maxwelton; Robert Riddel, Esq., of
Glenriddel, lineal descendant and representative of Walter Riddel, who
won the whistle, and in whose family it had continued; and Alexander
Fergusson, Esq., of Craigdarroch, likewise descended of the great Sir
Robert; which last gentleman carried off the hard-won honours of the
field.&#8221;</p>

<p>The jovial contest took place in the dining-room of Friars-Carse, in
the presence of the Bard, who drank bottle and bottle about with them,
and seemed quite disposed to take up the conqueror when the day
dawned.]</p>

loved to call her, was daughter to the odd and the elegant, the clever

Robert Chambers, &#8220;Monboddo was particularly unfortunate. His wife, a
very beautiful woman, died in child-bed. His son, a promising boy, in
whose education he took great delight, was likewise snatched from his
affections by a premature death; and his second daughter, in personal

<h4>LAMENT</h4>
<h5>FOR</h5>
<h3>JAMES, EARL OF GLENCAIRN.</h3>
<p>[Burns lamented the death of this kind and accomplished nobleman with
melancholy sincerity: he moreover named one of his sons for him: he
went into mourning when he heard of his death, and he sung of his
merits in a strain not destined soon to lose the place it has taken
among the verses which record the names of the noble and the generous.
He died January 30, 1791, in the forty-second year of his age. James
Cunningham was succeeded in his title by his brother, and with him
expired, in 1796, the last of a race, whose name is intimately
connected with the History of Scotland, from the days of Malcolm
Canmore.]</p>

<h4>ADDRESS</h4>
<h5>TO</h5>
<h3>THE SHADE OF THOMSON,</h3>
<h5>ON CROWNING HIS BUST AT EDNAM WITH BAYS.</h5>
<p>[&#8220;Lord Buchan has the pleasure to invite Mr. Burns to make one at the
coronation of the bust of Thomson, on Ednam Hill, on the 22d of
September: for which day perhaps his muse may inspire an ode suited to
the occasion. Suppose Mr. Burns should, leaving the Nith, go across
the country, and meet the Tweed at the nearest point from his farm,
and, wandering along the pastoral banks of Thomson&#8217;s pure parent
stream, catch inspiration in the devious walk, till he finds Lord
Buchan sitting on the ruins of Dryburgh. There the Commendator will
give him a hearty welcome, and try to light his lamp at the pure flame
of native genius, upon the altar of Caledonian virtue.&#8221; Such was the
invitation of the Earl of Buchan to Burns. To request the poet to lay
down his sickle when his harvest was half reaped, and traverse<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span> one of
the wildest and most untrodden ways in Scotland, for the purpose of
looking at the fantastic coronation of the bad bust of on excellent
poet, was worthy of Lord Buchan. The poor bard made answer, that a
week&#8217;s absence in the middle of his harvest was a step he durst not
venture upon&mdash;but he sent this Poem.</p>

Excise, which, while he lived in Edinburgh, he desired, but he also

<h3>A VISION.</h3>
<p>[This Vision of Liberty descended on Burns among the magnificent ruins
of the College of Lincluden, which stand on the junction of the Cluden
and the Nith, a short mile above Dumfries. He gave us the Vision;
perhaps, he dared not in those yeasty times venture on the song, which
his secret visitant poured from her lips. The scene is chiefly copied
from nature: the swellings of the Nith, the howling of the fox on the
hill, and the cry of the owl, unite at times with the natural beauty
of the spot, and give it life and voice. These ruins were a favourite
haunt of the poet.]</p>

<h3>JOHN MAXWELL OF TERRAUGHTY,</h3>
<h5>ON HIS BIRTHDAY.</h5>
<p>[John Maxwell of Terraughty and Munshes, to whom these verses are
addressed, though descended from the Earls of Nithsdale, cared little
about lineage, and claimed merit only from a judgment sound and
clear&mdash;a knowledge of business which penetrated into all the concerns
of life, and a skill in handling the most difficult subjects, which
was considered unrivalled. Under an austere manner, he hid much
kindness of heart, and was in a fair way of doing an act of gentleness
when giving a refusal. He loved to meet Burns: not that he either
cared for or comprehended poetry; but he was pleased with his
knowledge of human nature, and with the keen and piercing remarks in
which he indulged. He was seventy-one years old when these verses were
written, and survived the poet twenty years.]</p>

<p>[Miss Fontenelle was one of the actresses whom Williamson, the

perhaps maliciously, levities of action. The Rights of Man had been
advocated by Paine, the Rights of Woman by Mary Wol<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>stonecroft, and

<h3>MONODY,</h3>
<h5>ON A LADY FAMED FOR HER CAPRICE.</h5>
<p>[The heroine Of this rough lampoon was Mrs. Riddel of Woodleigh Park:
a lady young and gay, much of a wit, and something of a poetess, and
till the hour of his death the friend of Burns himself. She pulled his
displeasure on her, it is said, by smiling more sweetly than he liked
on some &#8220;epauletted coxcombs,&#8221; for so he sometimes designated
commissioned officers: the lady soon laughed him out of his mood. We
owe to her pen an account of her last interview with the poet, written
with great beauty and feeling.]</p>

<h3>ESOPUS TO MARIA.</h3>
<p>[Williamson, the actor, Colonel Macdouall, Captain Gillespie, and Mrs.
Riddel, are the characters which pass over the stage in this strange
composition: it is printed from the Poet&#8217;s own manuscript, and seems a
sort of outpouring of wrath and contempt, on persons who, in his eyes,
gave themselves airs beyond their condition, or their merits. The
verse of the lady is held up to contempt and laughter: the satirist
celebrates her</p>

<h4>POEM</h4>
<h3>ON PASTORAL POETRY.</h3>
<p>[Though Gilbert Burns says there is some doubt of this Poem being by
his brother, and though Robert Chambers declares that he &#8220;has scarcely
a doubt that it is not by the Ayrshire Bard,&#8221; I must print it as his,
for I have no doubt on the subject. It was found among the papers of
the poet, in his own handwriting: the second, the fourth, and the
concluding verses bear the Burns&#8217; stamp, which no one has been
successful in counterfeiting: they resemble the verses of Beattie, to
which Chambers has compared them, as little as the cry of the eagle
resembles the chirp of the wren.]</p>

<h5>THE BIRTHDAY OF THE AUTHOR, ON HEARING A</h5>

<p>[Burns was fond of a saunter in a leafless wood, when the winter storm
howled among the branches. These characteristic lines were composed on
the morning of his birthday, with the Nith at his feet, and the ruins
of Lincluden at his side: he is willing to accept the unlooked-for
song of the thrush as a fortunate omen.]</p>

<h4>SONNET,</h4>
<h5>ON THE</h5>
<h3>DEATH OF ROBERT RIDDEL, ESQ.</h3>
<h5>OF GLENRIDDEL,</h5>
<h5><span class="smcap">April, 1794.</span></h5>
<p>[The death of Glencairn, who was his patron, and the death of
Glenriddel, who was his friend, and had, while he lived at Ellisland,
been his neighbor, weighed hard on the mind of Burns, who, about this
time, began to regard his own future fortune with more of dismay than
of hope. Riddel united antiquarian pursuits with those of literature,
and experienced all the vulgar prejudices entertained by the peasantry
against those who indulge in such researches. His collection of what
the rustics of the vale called &#8220;queer quairns and swine-troughs,&#8221; is
now scattered or neglected: I have heard a competent judge say, that
they threw light on both the public and domestic history of Scotland.]</p>

<h3>THE VOWELS.</h3>
<h5>A TALE.</h5>
<p>[Burns admired genius adorned by learning; but mere learning without
genius he always regarded as pedantry. Those critics who scrupled too
much about words he called eunuchs of literature, and to one, who
taxed him with writing obscure language in questionable grammar, he
said, &#8220;Thou art but a Gretna-green match-maker between vowels and

<p>[With the &#8220;rough, rude, ready-witted Rankine,&#8221; of Adamhill, in
Ayrshire, Burns kept up a will o&#8217;-wispish sort of a correspondence in
rhyme, till the day of his death: these communications, of which this

that those lines were suggested by Falstaff&#8217;s account of his ragged

<p>[The too hospitable board of Mrs. Riddel occasioned these repentant

disrespect, but had allowed his tongue unbridled license of speech, on
the claim of political importance, and domestic equality, which Mary
Wolstonecroft and her followers patronized, at which Mrs. Riddel

<h3>TO CHLORIS.</h3>
<p>[Chloris was a Nithsdale beauty. Love and sorrow were strongly mingled
in her early history: that she did not look so lovely in other eyes as
she did in those of Burns is well known: but he had much of the taste
of an artist, and admired the elegance of her form, and the harmony of
her motion, as much as he did her blooming face and sweet voice.]</p>

<h3>POETICAL INSCRIPTION</h3>
<h4>FOR AN ALTAR TO INDEPENDENCE.</h4>
<p>[It was the fashion of the feverish times of the French Revolution to
plant trees of Liberty, and raise altars to Independence. Heron of
Kerroughtree, a gentleman widely esteemed in Galloway, was about to
engage in an election contest, and these noble lines served the
purpose of announcing the candidate&#8217;s sentiments on freedom.]</p>

<h3>THE HERON BALLADS.</h3>
<p class="std1">[BALLAD FIRST.]</p>

<p>[This is the first of several party ballads which Burns wrote to serve
Patrick Heron, of Kerroughtree, in two elections for the Stewartry of
Kirkcudbright, in which he was opposed, first, by Gordon of Balmaghie,
and secondly, by the Hon. Montgomery Stewart. There is a personal
bitterness in these lampoons, which did not mingle with the strains in
which the poet recorded the contest between Miller and Johnstone. They
are printed here as matters of poetry, and I feel sure that none will
be displeased, and some will smile.]</p>

<h3>THE HERON BALLADS.</h3>
<p class="std1">[BALLAD SECOND.]</p>

<p>[In this ballad the poet gathers together, after the manner of &#8220;Fy!
let us a&#8217; to the bridal,&#8221; all the leading electors of the Stewartry,
who befriended Heron, or opposed him; and draws their portraits in the
colours of light or darkness, according to the complexion of their
politics. He is too severe in most instances, and in some he is
venomous. On the Earl of Galloway&#8217;s family, and on the Murrays of
Broughton and Caillie, as well as on Bushby of Tinwaldowns, he pours
his hottest satire. But words which are unjust, or undeserved, fall
off their victims like rain-drops from a wild-duck&#8217;s wing. The Murrays
of Broughton and Caillie have long borne, from the vulgar, the stigma
of treachery to the cause of Prince Charles Stewart: from such infamy
the family is wholly free: the traitor, Murray, was of a race now
extinct; and while he was betraying the cause in which so much noble
and gallant blood was shed, Murray of Broughton and Caillie was
performing the duties of an honourable and loyal man: he was, like his
great-grandson now, representing his native district in parliament.]</p>

<h3>THE HERON BALLADS.</h3>
<p class="std1">[BALLAD THIRD.]</p>

<p>[This third and last ballad was written on the contest between Heron
and Stewart, which followed close on that with Gordon. Heron carried
the election, but was unseated by the decision of a Committee of the
House of Commons: a decision which it is said he took so much to heart
that it affected his health, and shortened his life.]</p>

<h4>POEM ON LIFE,</h4>
<h5>ADDRESSED TO</h5>
<h3>COLONEL DE PEYSTER.</h3>
<h4>DUMFRIES, 1796.</h4>
<p>[This is supposed to be the last Poem written by the hand, or
conceived by the muse of Burns. The person to whom it is addressed was
Colonel of the gentlemen Volunteers of Dumfries, in whose ranks Burns
was a private: he was a Canadian by birth, and prided himself on
having defended Detroit, against the united efforts of the French and
Americans. He was rough and austere, and thought the science of war
the noblest of all sciences: he affected a taste for literature, and
wrote verses.]</p>

verses, which I printed in my edition of the poet in 1834: it is
perhaps enough to say that the name of the one was Thomas and the name
of the other John.]</p>

<h3>PRAYER FOR ADAM ARMOUR.</h3>
<p>[The origin of this prayer is curious. In 1785, the maid-servant of an
innkeeper at Mauchline, having been caught in what old ballad-makers
delicately call &#8220;the deed of shame,&#8221; Adam Armour, the brother of the
poet&#8217;s bonnie Jean, with one or two more of his comrades, executed a
rustic act of justice upon her, by parading her perforce through the
village, placed on a rough, unpruned piece of wood: an unpleasant
ceremony, vulgarly called &#8220;Riding the Stang.&#8221; This was resented by
Geordie and Nanse, the girl&#8217;s master and mistress; law was restored
to, and as Adam had to hide till the matter was settled, he durst not
venture home till late on the Saturday nights. In one of these
home-comings he met Burns who laughed when he heard the story, and
said, &#8220;You have need of some one to pray for you.&#8221; &#8220;No one can do that
better than yourself,&#8221; was the reply, and this humorous intercession
was made on the instant, and, as it is said, &#8220;clean off loof.&#8221; From
Adam Armour I obtained the verses, and when he wrote them out, he told
the story in which the prayer originated.]</p>

Craigie-burn, near Moffat. It was composed in aid of the eloquence of
a Mr. Gillespie, who was in love with her: but it did not prevail, for
she married an officer of the name of Whelpdale, lived with him for a
month or so: reasons arose on both sides which rendered separation
necessary; she then took up her residence in Dumfries, where she had
many opportunities of seeing the poet. She lived till lately.]</p>

this song to Thomson; and one of his editors makes him say, &#8220;I think
this is one of the best love-songs I ever composed,&#8221; but these are not
the words of Burns; this contradiction is made openly, lest it should

of going to the West Indies, I took the following farewell of a dear
girl. You must know that all my earlier love-songs were the breathings
of ardent passion, and though it might have been easy in after times
to have given them a polish, yet that polish, to me, would have
defaced the legend of my heart, so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span> faithfully inscribed on them.

<h3>HIGHLAND MARY.</h3>

<p class="std1">Tune&mdash;&#8220;<i>Katherine Ogie.</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>[Mary Campbell, of whose worth and beauty Burns has sung with such
deep feeling, was the daughter of a mariner, who lived in Greenock.
She became acquainted with the poet while on service at the castle of
Montgomery, and their strolls in the woods and their roaming trysts
only served to deepen and settle their affections. Their love had much
of the solemn as well as of the romantic: on the day of their
separation they plighted their mutual faith by the exchange of Bibles:
they stood with a running-stream between them, and lifting up water in
their hands vowed love while woods grew and waters ran. The Bible
which the poet gave was elegantly bound: &#8216;Ye shall not swear by my
name falsely,&#8217; was written in the bold Mauchline hand of Burns, and
underneath was his name, and his mark as a freemason. They parted to
meet no more: Mary Campbell was carried off suddenly by a burning
fever, and the first intimation which the poet had of her fate, was
when, it is said, he visited her friends to meet her on her return
from Cowal, whither she had gone to make arrangements for her
marriage. The Bible is in the keeping of her relations: we have seen a
lock of her hair; it was very long and very bright, and of a hue
deeper than the flaxen. The song was written for Thomson&#8217;s work.]</p>

imitation of which Burns wrote his, and the Englishman complained,
with an oath, that the Scotchman sought to rob him of the merit of his
composition. Wolcot&#8217;s song was, indeed, written first, but they are
both but imitations of that most exquisite old ballad, &#8220;Fair Annie of
Lochryan,&#8221; which neither Wolcot nor Burns valued as it deserved: it

<h3>LOGAN WATER.</h3>

<p>[&#8220;Have you ever, my dear sir,&#8221; says Burns to Thomson, 25th June, 1793,
&#8220;felt your bosom ready to burst with indignation on reading of those
mighty villains who divide kingdom against kingdom, desolate
provinces, and lay nations waste, out of wantoness of ambition, or
often from still more ignoble passions? In a mood of this kind to-day
I recollected the air of Logan Water. If I have done anything at all
like justice to my feelings, the following song, composed in
three-quarters of an hour&#8217;s meditation in my elbow-chair, ought to
have some merit.&#8221; The poet had in mind, too, during this poetic fit,
the beautiful song of Logan-braes, by my friend John Mayne, a
Nithsdale poet.]</p>

<p>[There are snatches of old song so exquisitely fine that, like
fractured crystal, they cannot be mended or eked out, without showing
where the hand of the restorer has been. This seems the case with the
first verse of this song, which the poet found in Witherspoon, and
completed by the addition of the second verse, which he felt to be
inferior, by desiring Thomson to make his own the first verse, and let
the other follow, which would conclude the strain with a thought as
beautiful as it was original.]</p>

<p>[Jean M&#8217;Murdo, the heroine of this song, the eldest daughter of John
M&#8217;Murdo of Drumlanrig, was, both in merit and look, very worthy of so

him in the West, that his beauties were not other men&#8217;s beauties. In

<h3>BY ALLAN STREAM.</h3>

<p>[&#8220;Bravo! say I,&#8221; exclaimed Burns, when he wrote these verses for
Thomson. &#8220;It is a good song. Should you think so too, not else, you
can set the music to it, and let the other follow as English verses.
Autumn is my propitious season; I make more verses in it than all the
year else.&#8221; The old song of &#8220;O my love Annie&#8217;s very bonnie,&#8221; helped
the muse of Burns with this lyric.]</p>

Williamson, to escape the pursuit of the dragoons, in the time of the
persecution, was hid, by the devout Lady of Cherrytrees, in the same
bed with her ailing daughter. The divine lived to have six wives
beside the daughter of the Lady of Cherrytrees, and other children
besides the one which his hiding from the dragoons produced. When
 and its upshot, he is

<h3>BANNOCKBURN.</h3>
<h4>ROBERT BRUCE&#8217;S ADDRESS TO HIS ARMY.</h4>
<p class="std1">[SECOND VERSION.]</p>

<p>[Thomson acknowledged the charm which this martial and national ode
had for him, but he disliked the air, and proposed to substitute that
of Lewis Gordon in its place. But Lewis Gordon required a couple of
syllables more in every fourth line, which loaded the verse with
expletives, and weakened the simple energy of the original: Burns
consented to the proper alterations, after a slight resistance; but
when Thomson, having succeeded in this, proposed a change in the
expression, no warrior of Bruce&#8217;s day ever resisted more sternly the
march of a Southron over the border. &#8220;The only line,&#8221; says the
musician, &#8220;which I dislike in the whole song is,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8216;Welcome to your gory bed:&#8217;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>gory presents a disagreeable image to the mind, and a prudent general
would avoid saying anything to his soldiers which might tend to make
death more frightful than it is.&#8221; &#8220;My ode,&#8221; replied Burns, &#8220;pleases me
so much that I cannot alter it: your proposed alterations would, in my
opinion, make it tame.&#8221; Thomson cries out, like the timid wife of
Coriolanus, &#8220;Oh, God, no blood!&#8221; while Burns exclaims, like that
Roman&#8217;s heroic mother, &#8220;Yes, blood! it becomes a soldier more than
gilt his trophy.&#8221; The ode as originally written was restored

<h3>AULD LANG SYNE.</h3>

<p>[&#8220;Is not the Scotch phrase,&#8221; Burns writes to Mrs. Dunlop, &#8220;Auld lang
syne, exceedingly expressive? There is an old song and tune which has
often thrilled through my soul: I shall give you the verses on the
other sheet. Light be the turf on the breast of the heaven-inspired
poet who composed this glorious fragment.&#8221; &#8220;The following song,&#8221; says
the poet, when he communicated it to George Thomson, &#8220;an old song of
the olden times, and which has never been in print, nor even in
manuscript, until I took it down from an old man&#8217;s singing, is enough
to recommend any air.&#8221; These are strong words, but there can be no
doubt that, save for a line or two, we owe the song to no other
minstrel than &#8220;minstrel Burns.&#8221;]</p>

is scanty and confined, but the tones inexpressibly sweet, while the

as to look at page 245; vol. V., of Cunningham&#8217;s edition of Burns, he
will find the song; and if he will look at page 28, and page 193 of
vol. III., of his own edition, he will find that he has not committed
the error of which he accuses his fellow-editor, for he has inserted
the same song twice. The same may be said of the song to Chloris,
which Sir Harris has printed at page 312, vol. II,. and at page 189,

<h3>TO WILLIAM BURNESS.</h3>

<p>[This was written by Burns in his twenty-third year, when learning
flax-dressing in Irvine, and is the earliest of his letters which has
reached us. It has much of the scriptural deference to paternal
authority, and more of the Complete Letter Writer than we look for in
an original mind.]</p>

<p class="sig"><i>Irvine, Dec. 27, 1781.</i></p>

<p class="sig7"><span class="smcap">Honoured Sir</span>,</p>

<p>I have purposely delayed writing in the hope that I should have the
pleasure of seeing you on New-Year&#8217;s day; but work comes so hard upon
us, that I do not choose to be absent on that account, as well as for
some other little reasons which I shall tell you at meeting. My health
is nearly the same as when you were here, only my sleep is a little
sounder, and on the whole I am rather better than otherwise, though I
mend by very slow degrees. The weakness of my nerves has so
debilitated my mind, that I dare neither review past wants, nor look
forward into futurity; for the least anxiety or perturbation in my
breast produces most unhappy effects on my whole frame. Sometimes,
indeed, when for an hour or two my spirits are alightened, I glimmer a
little into futurity; but my principal, and indeed my only pleasurable
employment is looking backwards and forwards in a moral and religious
way; I am quite transported at the thought, that ere long, perhaps
very soon, I shall bid an eternal adieu to all the pains, and
uneasiness, and disquietudes of this weary life: for I assure you I am
heartily tired of it; and if I do not very much deceive myself, I
could contentedly and gladly resign it.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;The soul, uneasy, and confined at home,<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>It is for this reason I am more pleased with the 15th, 16th, and 17th
verses of the 7th chapter of Revelations, than with any ten times as
many verses in the whole Bible, and would not exchange the noble
enthusiasm with which they inspire me for all that this world has to
offer. As for this world, I despair of ever making a figure in it. I
am not formed for the bustle of the busy, nor the flutter of the gay.
I shall never again be capable of entering into such scenes. Indeed I
am altogether unconcerned at the thoughts of this life. I foresee that
poverty and obscurity probably await me, and I am in some measure
prepared, and daily preparing to meet them. I have but just time and
paper to return you my grateful thanks for the lessons of virtue and
piety you have given me, which were too much neglected at the time of
giving them, but which I hope have been remembered ere it is yet too
late. Present my dutiful respects to my mother, and my compliments <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>to Mr. and Mrs. Muir; and with wishing you a merry New-Year&#8217;s day, I shall conclude. I am, honoured sir, your dutiful son,</p>

teacher; and I wish I could gratify your curiosity with such a recital
as you would be pleased with; but that is what I am afraid will not be
the case. I have, indeed, kept pretty clear of vicious habits; and, in
this respect, I hope, my conduct will not disgrace the education I
have gotten; but, as a man of the world, I am most miserably
deficient. One would have thought that, bred as I have been, under a
father, who has figured pretty well as <i>un homme des affaires</i>, I
might have been, what the world calls, a pushing, active fellow; but
to tell you the truth, Sir, there is hardly anything more my reverse.
I seem to be one sent into the world to see and observe; and I very
easily compound with the knave who tricks me of my money, if there be
anything original about him, which shows me human nature in a
different light from anything I have seen before. In short, the joy of
my heart is to &#8220;study men, their manners, and their ways;&#8221; and for
this darling subject, I cheerfully sacrifice every other
consideration. I am quite indolent about those great concerns that set
the bustling, busy sons of care agog; and if I have to answer for the
present hour, I am very easy with regard to anything further. Even the
last, worst shift of the unfortunate and the wretched, does not much
terrify me: I know that even then, my talent for what country folks
call a &#8220;sensible crack,&#8221; when once it is sanctified by a hoary head,
would procure me so much esteem, that even then&mdash;I would learn to be
happy.<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> However, I am under no apprehensions about that; for though
indolent, yet so far as an extremely delicate constitution permits, I
am not lazy; and in many things, expecially in tavern matters, I am a
strict economist; not, indeed, for the sake of the money; but one of
the principal parts in my composition is a kind of pride of stomach;
and I scorn to fear the face of any man living: above everything, I
abhor as hell, the idea of sneaking in a corner to avoid a
dun&mdash;possibly some pitiful, sordid wretch, who in my heart I despise
and detest. &#8217;Tis this, and this alone, that endears economy to me. In
the matter of books, indeed, I am very profuse. My favourite authors
are of the sentimental kind, such as Shenstone, particularly his
&#8220;Elegies;&#8221; Thomson; &#8220;Man of Feeling&#8221;&mdash;a book I prize next to the
Bible; &#8220;Man of the World;&#8221; Sterne, especially his &#8220;Sentimental
Journey;&#8221; Macpherson&#8217;s &#8220;Ossian,&#8221; &amp;c.; these are the glorious models
after which I endeavour to form my conduct, and &#8217;tis incongruous, &#8217;tis
absurd to suppose that the man whose mind glows with sentiments
lighted up at their sacred flame&mdash;the man whose heart distends with
benevolence to all the human race&mdash;he &#8220;who can soar above this little
scene of things&#8221;&mdash;can he descend to mind the paltry concerns about
which the terr&aelig;filial race fret, and fume, and vex themselves! O how
the glorious triumph swells my heart! I forget that I am a poor,
insignificant devil, unnoticed and unknown, stalking up and down fairs
and markets, when I happen to be in them, reading a page or two of
mankind, and &#8220;catching the manners living as they rise,&#8221; whilst the
men of business jostle me on every side, as an idle encumbrance in
their way.&mdash;But I dare say I have by this time tired your patience; so
I shall conclude with begging you to give Mrs. Murdoch&mdash;not my
compliments, for that is a mere common-place story; but my warmest,
kindest <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
wishes for her welfare; and accept of the same for yourself, from,</p>

<h4>WRITER, MONTROSE.<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a></h4>
<p>[James Burness, son of the poet&#8217;s uncle, lives at Montrose, and, as
may be surmised, is now very old: fame has come to his house through
his eminent cousin Robert, and dearer still through his own grandson,
Sir Alexander Burnes, with whose talents and intrepidity the world is
well acquainted.]</p>

<p class="sig"><i>Lochlea</i>, 21<i>st June</i>, 1783.</p>

<p class="sig7"><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,</p>

<p>My father received your favour of the 10th current, and as he has been
for some months very poorly in health, and is in his own opinion (and
indeed, in almost everybody&#8217;s else) in a dying condition, he has only,
with great difficulty, written a few farewell lines to each of his
brothers-in-law. For this melancholy reason, I now hold the pen for
him to thank you for your kind letter, and to assure you, Sir, that it
shall not be my fault if my father&#8217;s correspondence in the north die
with him. My brother writes to John Caird, and to him I must refer you
for the news of our family.</p>

<p>I shall only trouble you with a few particulars relative to the
wretched state of this country. Our markets are exceedingly high;
oatmeal 17d. and 18d. per peck, and not to be gotten even at that
price. We have indeed been pretty well supplied with quantities of
white peas from England and elsewhere, but that resource is likely to
fail us, and what will become of us then, particularly the very
poorest sort, Heaven only knows. This country, till of late, was
flourishing incredibly in the manufacture of silk, lawn, and
carpet-weaving; and we are still carrying on a good deal in that way,
but much reduced from what it was. We had also a fine trade in the
shoe way, but now entirely ruined, and hundreds driven to a starving
condition on account of it. Farming is also at a very low ebb with us.
Our lands, generally speaking, are mountainous and barren; and our
landholders, full of ideas of farming gathered from the English and
the Lothians, and other rich soils in Scotland, make no allowance for
the odds of the quality of land, and consequently stretch us much
beyond what in the event we will be found able to pay. We are also
much at a loss for want of proper methods in our improvements of
farming. Necessity compels us to leave our old schemes, and few of us
have opportunities of being well informed in new ones. In short, my
dear Sir, since the unfortunate beginning of this American war, and
its as unfortunate conclusion, this country has been, and still is,
decaying very fast. Even in higher life, a couple of our Ayrshire
noblemen, and the major part of our knights and squires, are all
insolvent. A miserable job of a Douglas, Heron, and Co.&#8217;s bank, which
no doubt you heard of, has undone numbers of them; and imitating
English and French, and other foreign luxuries and fopperies, has
ruined as many more. There is a great trade of smuggling carried on
along our coasts, which, however destructive to the interests of the
kingdom at large, certainly enriches this corner of it, but too often
at the expense of our morals. However, it enables individuals to make,
at least for a time, a splendid appearance; but Fortune, as is usual
with her when she is uncommonly lavish of her favours, is generally
even with them at the last; and happy were it for numbers of them if
she would leave them no worse than when she found them.</p>

<p>My mother sends you a small present of a cheese, &#8217;tis but a very
little one, as our last year&#8217;s stock is sold off; but if you could fix
on any correspondent in Edinburgh or Glasgow, we would send you a
proper one in the season. Mrs. Black promises to take the cheese under
her care so far, and then to send it to you by the Stirling carrier.</p>

<p>I shall conclude this long letter with assuring you that I shall be
very happy to hear from you, or any of our friends in your country,
when opportunity serves.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span></p>
<p>My father sends you, probably for the last time in this world, his
warmest wishes for your welfare and happiness; and my mother and the
rest of the family desire to enclose their kind compliments to you,
Mrs. Burness, and the rest of your family, along with those of,</p>

<h3>TO MISS E.</h3>

<p>[The name of the lady to whom this and the three succeeding letters
were addressed, seems to have been known to Dr. Currie, who introduced
them in his first edition, but excluded them from his second. They
were restored by Gilbert Burns, without naming the lady.]</p>

<p class="sig"><i>Lochlea</i>, 1783.</p>

<p>I verily believe, my dear E., that the pure, genuine feelings of love
are as rare in the world as the pure genuine principles of virtue and
piety. This I hope will account for the uncommon style of all my
letters to you. By uncommon, I mean their being written in such a
serious manner, which, to tell you the truth, has made me often afraid
lest you should take me for some zealous bigot, who conversed with his
mistress as he would converse with his minister. I don&#8217;t know how it
is, my dear, for though, except your company, there is nothing on
earth gives me much pleasure as writing to you, yet it never gives me
those giddy raptures so much talked of among lovers. I have often
thought that if a well-grounded affection be not really a part of
virtue, &#8217;tis something extremely akin to it. Whenever the thought of
my E. warms my heart, every feeling of humanity, every principle of
generosity kindles in my breast. It extinguishes every dirty spark of
malice and envy which are but too apt to infest me. I grasp every
creature in the arms of universal benevolence, and equally participate
in the pleasures of the happy, and sympathize with the miseries of the
unfortunate. I assure you, my dear, I often look up to the Divine
Disposer of events with an eye of gratitude for the blessing which I
hope he intends to bestow on me in bestowing you. I sincerely wish
that he may bless my endeavors to make your life as comfortable and
happy as possible, both in sweetening the rougher parts of my natural
temper, and bettering the unkindly circumstances of my fortune. This,
my dear, is a passion, at least in my view, worthy of a man, and I
will add worthy of a Christian. The sordid earth-worm may profess love
to a woman&#8217;s person, whilst in reality his affection is centred in her
pocket; and the slavish drudge may go a-wooing as he goes to the
horse-market to choose one who is stout and firm, and as we may say of
an old horse, one who will be a good drudge and draw kindly. I disdain
their dirty, puny ideas. I would be heartily out of humour with myself
if I thought I were capable of having so poor a notion of the sex,
which were designed to crown the pleasures of society. Poor devils! I
don&#8217;t envy them their happiness who have such notions. For my part, I
propose quite other pleasures with my dear partner.</p>

<h3>TO MISS E.</h3>

<p class="sig"><i>Lochlea</i>, 1783.</p>

<p class="sig7"><span class="smcap">My dear E.</span>:</p>

<p>I do not remember, in the course of your acquaintance and mine, ever
to have heard your opinion on the ordinary way of falling in love,
amongst people of our station of life: I do not mean the persons who
proceed in the way of bargain, but those whose affection is really
placed on the person.</p>

<p>Though I be, as you know very well, but a very awkward lover myself,
yet as I have some opportunities of observing the conduct of others
who are much better skilled in the affair of courtship than I am, I
often think it is owing to lucky chance more than to good management,
that there are not more unhappy marriages than usually are.</p>

<p>It is natural for a young fellow to like the acquaintance of the
females, and customary for him to keep them company when occasion
serves: some one of them is more agreeable to him than the rest; there
is something, he knows not what, pleases him, he knows not how, in her
company. This I take to be what is called love with the greater part
of us; and I must own, dear E., it is a hard game, such a one as you
have to play when you meet with such a lover. You cannot refuse but he
is sincere, and yet though you use him ever so favourably, per<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>haps in
a few months, or at farthest in a year or two, the same unaccountable
fancy may make him as distractedly fond of another, whilst you are
quite forgot. I am aware that perhaps the next time I have the
pleasure of seeing you, you may bid me take my own lesson home, and
tell me that the passion I have professed for you is perhaps one of
those transient flashes I have been describing; but I hope, my dear
E., you will do me the justice to believe me, when I assure you that
the love I have for you is founded on the sacred principles of virtue
and honour, and by consequence so long as you continue possessed of
those amiable qualities which first inspired my passion for you, so
long must I continue to love you. Believe me, my dear, it is love like
this alone which can render the marriage state happy. People may talk
of flames and raptures as long as they please, and a warm fancy, with
a flow of youthful spirits, may make them feel something like what
they describe; but sure I am the nobler faculties of the mind, with
kindred feelings of the heart, can only be the foundation of
friendship, and it has always been my opinion that the married life
was only friendship in a more exalted degree. If you will be so good
as to grant my wishes, and it should please Providence to spare us to
the latest periods of life, I can look forward and see that even then,
though bent down with wrinkled age; even then, when all other worldly
circumstances will be indifferent to me, I will regard my E. with the
tenderest affection, and for this plain reason, because she is still
possessed of those noble qualities, improved to a much higher degree,
which first inspired my affection for her.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;O! happy state when souls each other draw,<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>I know were I to speak in such a style to many a girl, who thinks
herself possessed of no small share of sense, she would think it
ridiculous; but the language of the heart is, my dear E., the only
courtship I shall ever use to you.</p>

<p>When I look over what I have written, I am sensible it is vastly
different from the ordinary style of courtship, but I shall make no
apology&mdash;I know your good nature will excuse what your goody sense may
see amiss.</p>

<p class="sig"><i>Lochlea</i>, 1783.</p>

<p>I have often thought it a peculiarly unlucky circumstance in love,
that though in every other situation in life, telling the truth is not
only the safest, but actually by far the easiest way of proceeding, a
lover is never under greater difficulty in acting, or more puzzled for
expression, than when his passion is sincere, and his intentions are
honourable. I do not think that it is very difficult for a person of
ordinary capacity to talk of love and fondness, which are not felt,
and to make vows of constancy and fidelity, which are never intended
to be performed, if he be villain enough to practise such detestable
conduct: but to a man whose heart glows with the principles of
integrity and truth, and who sincerely loves a woman of amiable
person, uncommon refinement of sentiment and purity of manners&mdash;to
such an one, in such circumstances, I can assure you, my dear, from my
own feelings at this present moment, courtship is a task indeed. There
is such a number of foreboding fears and distrustful anxieties crowd
into my mind when I am in your company, or when I sit down to write to
you, that what to speak, or what to write, I am altogether at a loss.</p>

<p>There is one rule which I have hitherto practised, and which I shall
invariably keep with you, and that is honestly to tell you the plain
truth. There is something so mean and unmanly in the arts of
dissimulation and falsehood, that I am surprised they can be acted by
any one in so noble, so generous a passion, as virtuous love. No, my
dear E., I shall never endeavour to gain your favour by such
detestable practices. If you will be so good and so generous as to
admit me for your partner, your companion, your bosom friend through
life, there is nothing on this side of eternity shall give me greater
transport; but I shall never think of purchasing your hand by any arts
unworthy of a man, and I will add of a Christian. There is one thing,
my dear, which I earnestly request of you, and it is this; that you
would soon either put an end to my hopes by a peremptory refusal, or
cure me of my fears by a generous consent.</p>

<p>It would oblige me much if you would send me a line or two when
convenient. I shall only add further that, if a behaviour regulated
(though perhaps but very imperfectly) by the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span> rules of honour and
virtue, if a heart devoted to love and esteem you, and an earnest
endeavour to promote your happiness; if these are qualities you would
wish in a friend, in a husband, I hope you shall ever find them in
your real friend, and sincere lover.</p>

<p>I ought, in good manners, to have acknowledged the receipt of your
letter before this time, but my heart was so shocked, with the
contents of it, that I can scarcely yet collect my thoughts so as to
write you on the subject. I will not attempt to describe what I felt
on receiving your letter. I read it over and over, again and again,
and though it was in the politest language of refusal, still it was
peremptory; &#8220;you were sorry you could not make me a return, but you
wish me,&#8221; what without you I never can obtain, &#8220;you wish me all kind
of happiness.&#8221; It would be weak and unmanly to say that, without you I
never can be happy; but sure I am, that sharing life with you would
have given it a relish, that, wanting you, I can never taste.</p>

<p>Your uncommon personal advantages, and your superior good sense, do
not so much strike me; these, possibly, in a few instances may be met
with in others; but that amiable goodness, that tender feminine
softness, that endearing sweetness of disposition, with all the
charming offspring of a warm feeling heart&mdash;these I never again expect
to meet with, in such a degree, in this world. All these charming
qualities, heightened by an education much beyond anything I have ever
met in any woman I ever dared to approach, have made an impression on
my heart that I do not think the world can ever efface. My imagination
had fondly flattered myself with a wish, I dare not say it ever
reached a hope, that possibly I might one day call you mine. I had
formed the most delightful images, and my fancy fondly brooded over
them; but now I am wretched for the loss of what I really had no right
to expect. I must now think no more of you as a mistress; still I
presume to ask to be admitted as a friend. As such I wish to be
allowed to wait on you, and as I expect to remove in a few days a
little further off, and you, I suppose, will perhaps soon leave this
place, I wish to see or hear from you soon; and if an expression
should perhaps escape me, rather too warm for friendship, I hope you
will pardon it in, my dear Miss&mdash;(pardon me the dear expression for
once) * * * *</p>

<h3>TO ROBERT RIDDEL, ESQ.</h3>

<h4>OF GLENRIDDEL</h4>

<p>[These memoranda throw much light on the early days of Burns, and on
the history of his mind and compositions. Robert Riddel, of the
Friars-Carse, to whom these fragments were sent, was a good man as
well as a distinguished antiquary.]</p>

<p class="sig7"><span class="smcap">My Dear Sir</span>,</p>

<p>On rummaging over some old papers I lighted on a MS. of my early
years, in which I had determined to write myself out; as I was placed
by fortune among a class of men to whom my ideas would have been
nonsense. I had meant that the book should have lain by me, in the
fond hope that some time or other, even after I was no more, my
thoughts would fall into the hands of somebody capable of appreciating
their value. It sets off thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Observations, Hints, Songs, Scraps of Poetry</span>, &amp;c., by
<span class="smcap">Robert Burness</span>: a man who had little art in making money, and
still less in keeping it; but was, however, a man of some sense, a
great deal of honesty, and unbounded good-will to every creature,
rational and irrational.&mdash;As he was but little indebted to scholastic
education, and bred at a plough-tail, his performances must be
strongly tinctured with his unpolished, rustic way of life; but as I
believe they are really his own, it may be some entertainment to a
curious observer of human nature to see how a ploughman thinks, and
feels, under the pressure of love, ambition, anxiety, grief, with the
like cares and passions, which, however diversified by the modes and
manners of life, operate pretty much alike, I believe, on all the
species.&#8221;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;There are numbers in the world who do not want sense to
make a figure, so much as an opinion of their own abilities
to put them upon recording their observations, and allowing
them the same importance which they do to those which appear
in print.&#8221;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Shenstone.</span></p></div>

<p>Notwithstanding all that has been said against love, respecting the
folly and weakness it lends a young inexperienced mind into; still I
think it in a great measure deserves the highest encomiums that have
been passed upon it. If anything on earth deserves the name of rapture
or transport, it is the feelings of green eighteen in the company of
the mistress of his heart, when she repays him with an equal return of
affection.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p class="sig"><i>August.</i></p>

<p>There is certainly some connexion between love and music, and poetry;
and therefore, I have always thought it a fine touch of nature, that
passage in a modern love-composition:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;As towards her cot she jogged along,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Her name was frequent in his song.&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>For my own part I never had the least thought or inclination of
turning poet till I got once heartily in love, and then rhyme and song
were in a manner the spontaneous language of my heart. The following
composition was the first of my performances, and done at an early
period of life, when my heart glowed with honest warm simplicity;
unacquainted and uncorrupted with the ways of a wicked world. The
performance is indeed, very puerile and silly; but I am always pleased
with it, as it recalls to my mind those happy days when my heart was
yet honest, and my tongue was sincere. The subject of it was a young
girl who really deserved all the praises I have bestowed on her. I not
only had this opinion of her then&mdash;but I actually think so still, now
that the spell is long since broken, and the enchantment at an end.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">O once I lov&#8217;d a bonnie lass.<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Lest my works should be thought below criticism: or meet with a
critic, who, perhaps, will not look on them with so candid and
favourable an eye, I am determined to criticise them myself.</p>

<p>The first distich of the first stanza is quite too much in the flimsy
strain of our ordinary street ballads: and, on the other hand, the
second distich is too much in the other extreme. The expression is a
little awkward, and the sentiment too serious. Stanza the second I am
well pleased with; and I think it conveys a fine idea of that amiable
part of the sex&mdash;the agreeables; or what in our Scotch dialect we call
a sweet sonsie lass. The third stanza has a little of the flimsy turn
in it; and the third line has rather too serious a cast. The fourth
stanza is a very indifferent one; the first line, is, indeed, all in
the strain of the second stanza, but the rest is most expletive. The
thoughts in the fifth stanza come finely up to my favourite idea&mdash;a
sweet sonsie lass: the last line, however, halts a little. The same
sentiments are kept up with equal spirit and tenderness in the sixth
stanza, but the second and fourth lines ending with short syllables
hurt the whole. The seventh stanza has several minute faults; but I
remember I composed it in a wild enthusiasm of passion, and to this
hour I never recollect it but my heart melts, my blood sallies, at the
remembrance.</p>

<p>I entirely agree with that judicious philosopher, Mr. Smith, in his
excellent Theory of Moral Sentiments, that remorse is the most painful
sentiment that can embitter the human bosom. Any ordinary pitch of
fortitude may bear up tolerably well under those calamities, in the
procurement of which we ourselves have had no hand; but when our own
follies, or crimes, have made us miserable and wretched, to bear up
with manly firmness, and at the same time have a proper penitent sense
of our misconduct, is a glorious effort of self-command.</p>

<p>I have often observed, in the course of my experience of human life,
that every man, even the worst, has something good about him; though
very often nothing else than a happy temperament of constitution
inclining him to this or that virtue. For this reason no man can say
in what degree any other person, besides himself, can be, with strict
justice, called wicked. Let any, of the strictest character for
regularity of conduct among us, examine impartially how many vices he
has never been guilty of, not from any care or vigilance, but for want
of opportunity, or some accidental circumstance intervening; how many
of the weaknesses of mankind he has escaped, because he was out of the
line of such temptation; and, what often, if not always, weighs more
than all the rest, how much he is indebted to the world&#8217;s good
opinion, because the world does not know all: I say, any man who can
thus think, will scan the failings, nay, the faults and crimes, of
mankind around him, with a brother&#8217;s eye.</p>

<p>I have often courted the acquaintance of that part of mankind,
commonly known by the ordinary phrase of blackguards, sometimes
farther than was consistent with the safety of my character; those who
by thoughtless prodigality or headstrong passions, have been driven to
ruin. Though disgraced by follies, nay sometimes, stained with guilt,
I have yet found among them, in not a few instances, some of the
noblest virtues, magnanimity, generosity, disinterested friendship,
and even modesty.</p>

<p>As I am what the men of the world, if they knew such a man, would call
a whimsical mortal, I have various sources of pleasure and enjoyment,
which are, in a manner, peculiar to myself, or some here and there
such other out-of-the-way person. Such is the peculiar pleasure I take
in the season of winter, more than the rest of the year. This, I
believe, may be partly owing to my misfortunes giving my mind a
melancholy cast: but there is something even in the&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;Mighty tempest, and the hoary waste<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Abrupt and deep, stretch&#8217;d o&#8217;er the buried earth,&#8221;&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>which raises the mind to a serious sublimity, favourable to everything
great and noble. There is scarcely any earthly object gives me more&mdash;I
do not know if I should call it pleasure&mdash;but something which exalts
me, something which enraptures me&mdash;than to walk in the sheltered side
of a wood, or high plantation, in a cloudy winter-day, and hear the
stormy wind howling among the trees, and raving over the plain. It is
my best season for devotion: my mind is wrapt up in a kind of
enthusiasm to Him, who, in the pompous language of the Hebrew bard,
&#8220;walks on the wings of the wind.&#8221; In one of these seasons, just after
a train of misfortunes, I composed the following:&mdash;</p>

<p>Shenstone finely observes, that love-verses, writ without any real
passion, are the most nauseous of all conceits; and I have often
thought that no man can be a proper critic of love-composition, except
he himself, in one or more instances, have been a warm votary of this
passion. As I have been all along a miserable dupe to love, and have
been led into a thousand weaknesses and follies by it, for that reason
I put the more confidence in my critical skill, in distinguishing
foppery and conceit from real passion and nature. Whether the
following song will stand the test, I will not pretend to say, because
it is my own; only I can say it was, at the time, genuine from the
heart:&mdash;</p>

<p>I think the whole species of young men may be naturally enough divided
into two grand classes, which I shall call the <i>grave</i> and the
<i>merry</i>; though, by the by, these terms do not with propriety enough
express my ideas. The grave I shall cast into the usual division of
those who are goaded on by the love of money, and those whose darling
wish is to make a figure in the world. The merry are the men of
pleasure of all denominations; the jovial lads, who have too much fire
and spirit to have any settled rule of action; but, without much
deliberation, follow the strong impulses of nature: the thoughtless,
the careless, the indolent&mdash;in particular <i>he</i> who, with a happy
sweetness of natural temper, and a cheerful vacancy of thought, steals
through life&mdash;generally, indeed, in poverty and obscurity; but poverty
and obscurity are only evils to him who can sit gravely down and make
a repining comparison between his own situation and that of others;
and lastly, to grace the quorum, such are, generally, those whose
heads are capable of all the towerings of genius, and whose hearts are
warmed with all the delicacy of feeling.</p>

<p>The foregoing was to have been an elaborate dissertation on the

arrangement of my ideas, I must wait till farther experience and nicer
observation throw more light on the subject.&mdash;In the mean time I shall
set down the following fragment, which, as it is the genuine language
of my heart, will enable anybody to determine which of the classes I
belong to:</p>

<p>As the grand end of human life is to cultivate an intercourse with
that <span class="smcap">Being</span> to whom we owe life, with every enjoyment that
renders life delightful; and to maintain an integritive conduct
towards our fellow-creatures; that so, by forming piety and virtue
into habit, we may be fit members for that society of the pious and
the good, which reason and revelation teach us to expect beyond the
grave, I do not see that the turn of mind, and pursuits of such a one
as the above verses describe&mdash;one who spends the hours and thoughts
which the vocations of the day can spare with Ossian, Shakspeare,
Thomson, Shenstone, Sterne, &amp;c.; or, as the maggot takes him, a gun, a
fiddle, or a song to make or mend; and at all times some heart&#8217;s-dear
bonnie lass in view&mdash;I say I do not see that the turn of mind and
pursuits of such an one are in the least more inimical to the sacred
interests of piety and virtue, than the even lawful, bustling and
straining after the world&#8217;s riches and honours: and I do not see but
he may gain heaven as well&mdash;which, by the by, is no mean
consideration&mdash;who steals through the vale of life, amusing himself
with every little flower that fortune throws in his way, as he, who
straining straight forward, and perhaps spattering all about him,
gains some of life&#8217;s little eminencies, where, after all, he can only
see and be seen a little more conspicuously than what, in the pride of
his heart, he is apt to term the poor, indolent devil he has left
behind him.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t well know what is the reason of it, but somehow or other,

<p>However I am pleased with the works of our Scotch poets, particularly
the excellent Ramsay, and the still more excellent Fergusson, yet I am
hurt to see other places of Scotland, their towns, rivers, woods,
haughs, &amp;c., immortalized in such celebrated performances, while my
dear native country, the ancient bailieries of Carrick, Kyle, and
Cunningham, famous both in ancient and modern times for a gallant and
warlike race of inhabitants; a country where civil, and particularly
religious liberty have ever found their first support, and their last
asylum; a country, the birth-place of many famous philosophers,
soldiers, statesman, and the scene of many important events recorded
in Scottish history, particularly a great many of the actions of the
glorious <span class="smcap">Wallace</span>, the <span class="smcap">Saviour</span> of his country; yet,
we have never had one Scotch poet of any eminence, to make the fertile
banks of Irvine, the romantic woodlands and sequestered scenes on Ayr,
and the healthy mountainous source and winding sweep of <span class="smcap">Doon</span>,
emulate Tay, Forth, Ettrick, Tweed, &amp;c. This is a complaint I would
gladly remedy, but, alas! I am far unequal to the task, both in native
genius and education. Obscure I am, and obscure I must be, though no

<p>There is a great irregularity in the old Scotch songs, a redundancy of
syllables with respect to that exactness of accent and measure that
the English poetry requires, but which glides in, most melodiously,
with the respective tunes to which they are set. For instance, the
fine old song of &#8220;The Mill, Mill, O,&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> to give it a plain prosaic
reading, it halts prodigiously out of measure; on the other hand, the
song set to the same tune in Bremner&#8217;s collection of Scotch songs,
which begins &#8220;To Fanny fair could I impart,&#8221; &amp;c., it is most exact
measure, and yet, let them both be sung before a real critic, one
above the biases of prejudice, but a thorough judge of nature,&mdash;how
flat and spiritless will the last appear, how trite, and lamely
methodical, compared with the wild warbling cadence, the heart-moving
melody of the first!&mdash;This is particularly the case with all those
airs which end with a hypermetrical syllable. There is a degree of
wild irregularity in many of the compositions and fragments which are
daily sung to them by my compeers, the common people&mdash;a certain happy
arrangement of old Scotch syllables, and yet, very frequently,
nothing, not even like rhyme or sameness of jingle, at the ends of the
lines. This has made me sometimes imagine that perhaps it might be
possible for a Scotch poet, with a nice judicious ear, to set
compositions to many of our most favourite airs, particularly that
class of them mentioned above, independent of rhyme altogether.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>There is a noble sublimity, a heart-melting tenderness, in some of our
ancient ballads, which show them to be the work of a masterly hand:
and it has often given me many a heart-ache to reflect that such
glorious old bards&mdash;bards who very probably owed all their talents to
native genius, yet have described the exploits of heroes, the pangs of
disappointment, and the meltings of love, with such fine strokes of
nature&mdash;that their very names (O how mortifying to a bard&#8217;s vanity!)
are now &#8220;buried among the wreck of things which were.&#8221;</p>

<p>O ye illustrious names unknown! who could feel so strongly and
describe so well: the last, the meanest of the muses&#8217; train&mdash;one who,
though far inferior to your flights, yet eyes <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>your path, and with
trembling wing would sometimes soar after you&mdash;a poor rustic bard
unknown, pays this sympathetic pang to your memory! Some of you tell
us, with all the charms of verse, that you have been unfortunate in
the world&mdash;unfortunate in love: he, too, has felt the loss of his
little fortune, the loss of friends, and, worse than all, the loss of
the woman he adored. Like you, all his consolation was his muse: she
taught him in rustic measures to complain. Happy could he have done it
with your strength of imagination and flow of verse! May the turf lie
lightly on your bones! and may you now enjoy that solace and rest
which this world rarely gives to the heart tuned to all the feelings
of poesy and love!</p>

<p>The following fragment is done something in imitation of the manner of
a noble old Scottish piece, called M&#8217;Millan&#8217;s Peggy, and sings to the
tune of Galla Water.&mdash;My Montgomery&#8217;s Peggy was my deity for six or
eight months. She had been bred (though, as the world says, without
any just pretence for it) in a style of life rather elegant; but, as
Vanbrugh says in one of his comedies, my &#8220;d&mdash;&mdash;d star found me out&#8221;
there too: for though I began the affair merely in a <i>gaiti&eacute; de
c&oelig;ur</i>, or, to tell the truth, which will scarcely be believed, a
vanity of showing my parts in courtship, particularly my abilities at
a <i>billet-doux</i>, which I always piqued myself upon, made me lay siege
to her; and when, as I always do in my foolish gallantries, I had
fettered myself into a very warm affection for her, she told me one
day, in a flag of truce, that her fortress had been for some time
before the rightful property of another; but, with the greatest
friendship and politeness, she offered me every allegiance except
actual possession. I found out afterwards that what she told me of a
pre-engagement was really true; but it cost me some heart-aches to get
rid of the affair.</p>

in the rhymes, which, when judiciously done, has such a fine effect on

<p>There is another fragment in imitation of an old Scotch song, well
known among the country ingle-sides.&mdash;I cannot tell the name, neither
of the song nor the tune, but they are in fine unison with one
another.&mdash;By the way, these old Scottish airs are so nobly
sentimental, that when one would compose to them, to &#8220;south the tune,&#8221;
as our Scotch phrase is, over and over, is the readiest way to catch
the inspiration, and raise the bard into that glorious enthusiasm so
strongly characteristic of our old Scotch poetry. I shall here set
down one verse of the piece mentioned above, both to mark the song and
tune I mean, and likewise as a debt I owe to the author, as the
repeating of that verse has lighted up my flame a thousand times:&mdash;</p>

<p>The above was an extempore, under the pressure of a heavy train of
misfortunes, which, indeed, threatened to undo me altogether. It was
just at the close of that dreadful period mentioned already, and
though the weather has brightened up a little with me, yet there has
always been since a tempest brewing round me in the grim sky of
futurity, which I pretty plainly see will some time or other, perhaps
ere long, overwhelm me, and drive me into some doleful dell, to pine
in solitary, squalid wretchedness.&mdash;However, as I hope my poor country
muse, who, all rustic, awkward, and unpolished as she is, has more
charms for me than any other of the pleasures of life beside&mdash;as I
hope she will not then desert me, I may even then learn to be, if not
happy, at least easy, and south a sang to soothe my misery.</p>

<p>&#8217;Twas at the same time I set about composing an air in the old Scotch
style.&mdash;I am not musical <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>scholar enough to prick down my tune properly, so it can never see the
light, and perhaps &#8217;tis no great matter; but the following were the
verses I composed to suit it:&mdash;</p>

<h3>TO MR. JAMES BURNESS,</h3>

<h4>MONTROSE.</h4>

<p>[The elder Burns, whose death this letter intimates, lies buried in
the kirk-yard of Alloway, with a tombstone recording his worth.]</p>

<p class="sig"><i>Lochlea</i>, 17<i>th Feb.</i> 1784.</p>

<p class="sig7"><span class="smcap">Dear Cousin</span>,</p>

<p>I would have returned you my thanks for your kind favour of the 13th
of December sooner, had it not been that I waited to give you an
account of that melancholy event, which, for some time past, we have
from day to day expected.</p>

<p>On the 13th current I lost the best of fathers. Though, to be sure, we
have had long warning of the impending stroke; still the feelings of
nature claim their part, and I cannot recollect the tender endearments
and parental lessons of the best of friends and ablest of instructors,
without feeling what perhaps the calmer dictates of reason would
partly condemn.</p>

<p>I hope my father&#8217;s friends in your country will not let their
connexion in this place die with him. For my part I shall ever with
pleasure&mdash;with pride, acknowledge my connexion with those who were
allied by the ties of blood and friendship to a man whose memory I
shall ever honour and revere.</p>

<p>I expect, therefore, my dear Sir, you will not neglect any opportunity
of letting me hear from you, which will very much oblige,</p>

<h3>TO JAMES BURNESS,</h3>

<h4>MONTROSE.</h4>

<p>[Mrs. Buchan, the forerunner in extravagance and absurdity of Joanna
Southcote, after attempting to fix her tent among the hills of the
west and the vales of the Nith, finally set up her staff at
Auchengibbert-Hill, in Galloway, where she lectured her followers, and
held out hopes of their reaching the stars, even in this life. She
died early: one or two of her people, as she called them, survived
till within these half-dozen years.]</p>

<p class="sig"><i>Mossgiel, August</i>, 1784.</p>

<p>We have been surprised with one of the most extraordinary phenomena in
the moral world which, I dare say, had happened in the course of this
half century. We have had a party of Presbytery relief, as they call
themselves, for some time in this country. A pretty thriving society
of them has been in the burgh of Irvine for some years past, till
about two years ago, a Mrs. Buchan from Glasgow came among them, and
began to spread some fanatical notions of religion among them, and, in
a short time, made many converts; and, among others, their preacher,
Mr. Whyte, who, upon that account, has been suspended and formally
deposed by his brethren. He continued, however, to preach in private
to his party, and was supported, both he and their spiritual mother,
as they affect to call old Buchan, by the contributions of the rest,
several of whom were in good circumstances; till, in spring last, the
populace rose and mobbed Mrs. Buchan, and put her out of the town; on
which all her followers voluntarily quitted the place likewise, and
with such precipitation, that many of them never shut their
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
doors behind them; one left a washing on the green, another a cow
bellowing at the crib without food, or anybody to mind her, and after
several stages, they are fixed at present in the neighbourhood of
Dumfries. Their tenets are a strange jumble of enthusiastic jargon;
among others, she pretends to give them the Holy Ghost by breathing on
them, which she does with postures and practices that are scandalously
indecent; they have likewise disposed of all their effects, and hold a
community of goods, and live nearly an idle life, carrying on a great
farce of pretended devotion in barns and woods, where they lodge and
lie all together, and hold likewise a community of women, as it is
another of their tenets that they can commit no mortal sin. I am
personally acquainted with most of them, and I can assure you the
above mentioned are facts.</p>

<p>This, my dear Sir, is one of the many instances of the folly of
leaving the guidance of sound reason and common sense in matters of
religion.</p>

<p>Whenever we neglect or despise these sacred monitors, the whimsical
notions of a perturbated brain are taken for the immediate influences
of the Deity, and the wildest fanaticism, and the most inconstant
absurdities, will meet with abettors and converts. Nay, I have often
thought, that the more out-of-the-way and ridiculous the fancies are,
if once they are sanctified under the sacred name of religion, the
unhappy mistaken votaries are the more firmly glued to them.</p>

<h3>TO MISS&mdash;&mdash;.</h3>

<p>[This has generally been printed among the early letters of Burns.
Cromek thinks that the person addressed was the &#8220;Peggy&#8221; of the
Common-place Book. This is questioned by Robert Chambers, who,
however, leaves both name and date unsettled.]</p>

<p class="sig7"><span class="smcap">My dear Countrywoman</span>,</p>

<p>I am so impatient to show you that I am once more at peace with you,
that I send you the book I mentioned directly, rather than wait the
uncertain time of my seeing you. I am afraid I have mislaid or lost
Collins&#8217; Poems, which I promised to Miss Irvin. If I can find them, I
will forward them by you; if not, you must apologize for me.</p>

<p>I know you will laugh at it when I tell you that your piano and you
together have played the deuce somehow about my heart. My breast has
been widowed these many months, and I thought myself proof against the
fascinating witchcraft; but I am afraid you will &#8220;feelingly convince
me what I am.&#8221; I say, I am afraid, because I am not sure what is the
matter with me. I have one miserable bad symptom; when you whisper, or
look kindly to another, it gives me a draught of damnation. I have a
kind of wayward wish to be with you ten minutes by yourself, though
what I would say, Heaven above knows, for I am sure I know not. I have
no formed design in all this; but just, in the nakedness of my heart,
write you down a mere matter-of-fact story. You may perhaps give
yourself airs of distance on this, and that will completely cure me;
but I wish you would not: just let us meet, if you please, in the old
beaten way of friendship.</p>

<p>I will not subscribe myself your humble servant, for that is a phrase,
I think at least fifty miles off from the heart; but I will conclude
with sincerely wishing that the Great Protector of innocence may
shield you from the barbed dart of calumny, and hand you by the covert
snare of deceit.</p>

<p>I have not time at present to upbraid you for your silence and
neglect; I shall only say I received yours with great pleasure. I have
enclosed you a piece of rhyming ware for your perusal. I have been
very busy with the muses since I saw you, and have composed, among
several others, &#8220;The Ordination,&#8221; a poem on Mr. M&#8217;Kinlay&#8217;s being

approbation of my works. Be so good as send me Fergusson, by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span> Connel,

about Mauchline, they are just going on in the old way. I have some
very important news with respect to myself, not the most
agreeable&mdash;news that I am sure you cannot guess, but I shall give you
the particulars another time. I am extremely happy with Smith; he is
the only friend I have now in Mauchline. I can scarcely forgive your
long neglect of me, and I beg you will let me hear from you regularly
by Connel. If you would act your part as a friend, I am sure neither
good nor bad fortune should strange of alter me. Excuse haste, as I

<p>I went to Dr. Douglas yesterday, fully resolved to take the
opportunity of Captain Smith: but I found the Doctor with a Mr. and
Mrs. White, both Jamaicans, and they have deranged my plans
altogether. They assure him that to send me from Savannah la Mar to
Port Antonio will cost my master, Charles Douglas, upwards of fifty
pounds; besides running the risk of throwing myself into a pleuritic
fever, in consequence of hard travelling in the sun. On these
accounts, he refuses sending me with Smith, but a vessel sails from
Greenock the first of September, right for the place of my
destination. The Captain of her is an intimate friend of Mr. Gavin
Hamilton&#8217;s, and as good a fellow as heart could wish: with him I am
destined to go. Where I shall shelter, I know not, but I hope to
weather the storm. Perish the drop of blood of mine that fears them! I

<p>I received your message by G. Patterson, and as I am not very throng
at present, I just write to let you know that there is such a
worthless, rhyming reprobate, as your humble servant, still in the
land of the living, though I can scarcely say, in the place of hope. I
have no news to tell you that will give me any pleasure to mention, or
you to hear.</p>

<p>Poor ill-advised ungrateful Armour came home on Friday last. You have
heard all the particulars of that affair, and a black affair it is.
What she thinks of her conduct now, I don&#8217;t know; one thing I do
know&mdash;she has made me completely miserable. Never man loved, or rather
adored a woman more than I did her; and, to confess a truth between
you and me, I do still love her to distraction after all, though I
won&#8217;t tell her so if I were to see her, which I don&#8217;t want to do. My
poor dear unfortunate Jean! how happy have I been in thy arms! It is
not the losing her that makes me so unhappy, but for her sake I feel
most severely: I foresee she is in the road to, I am afraid, eternal
ruin. * * * *</p>

<p>May Almighty God forgive her ingratitude and perjury to me, as I from
my very soul forgive her: and may his grace be with her and bless her
in all her future life! I can have no nearer idea of the place of
eternal punishment than what I have felt in my own breast on her
account. I have tried often to forget her; I have run into all kinds
of dissipation and riots, mason-meetings, drinking matches, and other
mischief, to drive her out of my head, but all in vain. And now for a
grand cure; the ship is on her way home that is to take me out to
Jamaica; and then, farewell dear old Scotland! and farewell dear
ungrateful Jean! for never never will I see you more.</p>

<h3>TO MR. ROBERT AIKEN.</h3>

<p>[This letter was written under great distress of mind. That separation
which Burns records in &#8220;The Lament,&#8221; had, unhappily, taken place
between him and Jean Armour, and it would appear, that for a time at
least a coldness ensued between the poet and the patron, occasioned,
it is conjectured, by that fruitful subject of sorrow and disquiet.
The letter, I regret to say, is not wholly here.]</p>

<p class="sig">[<i>Ayrshire</i>, 1786.]</p>

<p class="sig7"><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>

<p>I was with Wilson, my printer, t&#8217;other day, and settled all our
by-gone matters between us. After I had paid him all demands, I made
him the offer of the second edition, on the hazard of being paid out
of the first and readiest, which he declines. By his account, the
paper of a thousand copies would cost me about twenty-seven pounds,
and the printing about fifteen or sixteen: he offers to agree to this
for the printing, if I will advance for the paper, but this, you know,
is out of my power; so farewell hopes of a second edition till I grow
rich! an epoch which I think will arrive at the payment of the
British national debt.</p>

<p>There is scarcely anything hurts me so much in being disappointed of
my second edition, as not having it in my power to show my gratitude
to Mr. Ballantyne, by publishing my poem of &#8220;The Brigs of Ayr.&#8221; I
would detest myself as a wretch, if I thought I were capable in a very
long life of forgetting the honest, warm, and tender delicacy with
which he enters into my interests. I am sometimes pleased with myself
in my greateful sensations; but I believe, on the whole, I have very
little merit in it, as my gratitude is not a virtue, the consequence
of reflection; but sheerly the instinctive emotion of my heart, too
inattentive to allow worldly maxims and views to settle into selfish
habits.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span> I have been feeling all the various rotations and movements
within, respecting the excise. There are many things plead strongly
against it; the uncertainty of getting soon into business; the
consequences of my follies, which may perhaps make it impracticable
for me to stay at home; and besides I have for some time been pining
under secret wretchedness, from causes which you pretty well know&mdash;the
pang of disappointment, the sting of pride, with some wandering stabs
of remorse, which never fail to settle on my vitals like vultures,
when attention is not called away by the calls of society, or the
vagaries of the muse. Even in the hour of social mirth, my gayety is
the madness of an intoxicated criminal under the hands of the
executioner. All these reasons urge me to go abroad, and to all these
reasons I have only one answer&mdash;the feelings of a father. This, in the
present mood I am in, overbalances everything that can be laid in the
scale against it. * * * *</p>

<p>You may perhaps think it an extravagant fancy, but it is a sentiment
which strikes home to my very soul: though sceptical in some points of
our current belief, yet, I think, I have every evidence for the
reality of a life beyond the stinted bourne of our present existence;
if so, then, how should I, in the presence of that tremendous Being,
the Author of existence, how should I meet the reproaches of those who
stand to me in the dear relation of children, whom I deserted in the
smiling innocency of helpless infancy? O, thou great unknown
Power!&mdash;thou almighty God! who has lighted up reason in my breast, and
blessed me with immortality!&mdash;I have frequently wandered from that
order and regularity necessary for the perfection of thy works, yet
thou hast never left me nor forsaken me! * * * *</p>

<p>Since I wrote the foregoing sheet, I have seen something of the storm
of mischief thickening over my folly-devoted head. Should you, my
friends, my benefactors, be successful in your applications for me,
perhaps it may not be in my power, in that way, to reap the fruit of
your friendly efforts. What I have written in the preceding pages, is
the settled tenor of my present resolution; but should inimical
circumstances forbid me closing with your kind offer, or enjoying it
only threaten to entail farther misery&mdash; * * * *</p>

<p>To tell the truth, I have little reason for complaint; as the world,
in general, has been kind to me fully up to my deserts. I was, for
some time past, fast getting into the pining, distrustful snarl of the
misanthrope. I saw myself alone, unlit for the struggle of life,
shrinking at every rising cloud in the chance-directed atmosphere of
fortune, while all defenceless I looked about in vain for a cover. It
never occurred to me, at least never with the force it deserved, that
this world is a busy scene, and man, a creature destined for a
progressive struggle; and that, however I might possess a warm heart
and inoffensive manners (which last, by the by, was rather more than I
could well boast); still, more than these passive qualities, there was
something to be done. When all my school-fellows and youthful compeers
(those misguided few excepted who joined, to use a Gentoo phrase, the
&#8220;hallachores&#8221; of the human race) were striking off with eager hope and
earnest intent, in some one or other of the many paths of busy life, I
was &#8220;standing idle in the market-place,&#8221; or only left the chase of the
butterfly from flower to flower, to hunt fancy from whim to whim. * *
* *</p>

<p>You see, Sir, that if to know one&#8217;s errors were a probability of
mending them, I stand a fair chance; but according to the reverend
Westminster divines, though conviction must precede conversion, it is
very far from always implying it. * * * *</p>

penitence that might have been expected. However, the priest, I am

<p>[There is a plain account in this letter of the destruction of the

consequence of his advice, the certificate of marriage was destroyed.]</p>

<p>My proposals came to hand last night, and knowing that you would wish
to have it in your power to do me a service as early as anybody, I
enclose you half a sheet of them. I must consult you, first
opportunity, on the propriety of sending my quondam friend, Mr. Aiken,
a copy. If he is now reconciled to my character as an honest man, I
would do it with all my soul; but I would not be beholden to the
noblest being ever God created, if he imagined me to be a rascal.
Apropos, old Mr. Armour prevailed with him to mutilate that unlucky
paper yesterday. Would you believe it? though I had not a hope, nor
even a wish, to make her mine after her conduct; yet, when he told me
the names were all out of the paper, my heart died within me, and he
cut my veins with the news. Perdition seize her falsehood!</p>

<p>I have been so throng printing my Poems, that I could scarcely find as

I have already appeared publicly in church, and was indulged in the
liberty of standing in my own seat. I do this to get a certificate as
a bachelor, which Mr. Auld has promised me. I am now fixed to go for
the West Indies in October. Jean and her friends insisted much that
she should stand along with me in the kirk, but the minister would not
allow it, which bred a great trouble I assure you, and I am blamed as
the cause of it, though I am sure I am innocent; but I am very much
pleased, for all that, not to have had her company. I have no news to

second edition of his Poems. Her neglect in not replying to this
request is a very good poetic reason for his wrath. Many of Burns&#8217;s

<p class="sig7"><span class="smcap">Madam</span>,</p>

<p>Poets are such outr&eacute; beings, so much the children of wayward fancy and
capricious whim, that I believe the world generally allows them a
larger latitude in the laws of propriety, than the sober sons of
judgment and prudence. I mention this as an apology for the liberties
that a nameless stranger has taken with you in the enclosed poem,
which he begs leave to present you with. Whether it has poetical merit
any way worthy of the theme, I am not the proper judge; but it is the
best my abilities can produce; and what to a good heart will, perhaps,
be a superior grace, it is equally sincere as fervent.</p>

<p>The scenery was nearly taken from real life, though I dare say, Madam,
you do not recollect it, as I believe you scarcely noticed the poetic
reveur as he wandered by you. I had roved out as chance directed, in
the favourite haunts of my muse on the banks of the Ayr, to view
nature in all the gayety of the vernal year. The evening sun was
flaming over the distant western hills; not a breath stirred the
crimson opening blossom, or the verdant spreading leaf. It was a
golden moment for a poetic heart. I listened to the feathered
warblers, pouring their harmony on every hand, with a congenial
kindred regard, and frequently turned out of my path, lest I should
disturb their little songs, or frighten them to another station.
Surely, said I to myself, he must be a wretch indeed, who, regardless
of your harmonious endeavour to please him, can eye your elusive
flights to discover your secret recesses, and to rob you of all the
property nature gives you&mdash;your dearest comforts, your helpless
nestlings. Even the hoary hawthorn twig that shot across the way, what
heart at such a time but must have been interested in its welfare, and
wished it preserved from the rudely-browsing cattle, or the withering
eastern blast? Such was the scene,&mdash;and such the hour, when, in a
corner of my prospect, I spied one of the fairest pieces of nature&#8217;s
workmanship that ever crowned a poetic landscape or met a poet&#8217;s eye,
those visionary bards excepted, who hold commerce with a&euml;rial beings!
Had Calumny and Villany taken my walk, they had at that moment sworn
eternal peace with such an object.</p>

<p>What an hour of inspiration for a poet! It would have raised plain
dull historic prose into metaphor measure.</p>

<p>The enclosed song was the work of my return home: and perhaps it but
poorly answers what might have been expected from such a scene.</p>

<p>The hurry of my preparations for going abroad has hindered me from
performing my promise so soon as I intended. I have here sent you a
parcel of songs, &amp;c., which never made their appearance, except to a
friend or two at most. Perhaps some of them may be no great
entertainment to you, but of that I am far from being an adequate
judge. The song to the tune of &#8220;Ettrick Banks&#8221; [The bonnie lass of
Ballochmyle] you will easily see the impropriety of exposing much,
even in manuscript. I think, myself, it has some merit: both as a
tolerable description of one of nature&#8217;s sweetest scenes, a July
evening, and one of the finest pieces of nature&#8217;s workmanship, the
finest indeed we know anything of, an amiable, beautiful young
woman;<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> but I have no common friend to procure me that permission,
without which I would not dare to spread the copy.</p>

<p>I am quite aware, Madam, what task the world would assign me in this
letter. The obscure bard, when any of the great condescend to take
notice of him, should heap the altar with the incense of flattery.
Their high ancestry, their own great and godlike qualities and
actions, should be recounted with the most exaggerated description.
This, Madam, is a task for which I am altogether unfit. Besides a
certain disqualifying pride of heart, I know nothing of your
connexions in life, and have no access to where <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span> your real character is to be found&mdash;the company of your compeers: and more, I am afraid that even the most refined adulation is by no means
the road to your good opinion.</p>

<p>One feature of your character I shall ever with grateful pleasure
remember;&mdash;the reception I got when I had the honour of waiting on you
at Stair. I am little acquainted with politeness, but I know a good
deal of benevolence of temper and goodness of heart. Surely did those
in exalted stations know how happy they could make some classes of
their inferiors by condescension and affability, they would never
stand so high, measuring out with every look the height of their
elevation, but condescend as sweetly as did Mrs. Stewart of Stair.</p>

<p>I have paid every attention to your commands, but can only say what
perhaps you will have heard before this reach you, that Muirkirklands
were bought by a John Gordon, W.S., but for whom I know not;
Mauchlands, Haugh, Miln, &amp;c., by a Frederick Fotheringham, supposed to
be for Ballochmyle Laird, and Adamhill and Shawood were bought for
Oswald&#8217;s folks.&mdash;This is so imperfect an account, and will be so late
ere it reach you, that were it not to discharge my conscience I would
not trouble you with it; but after all my diligence I could make it no
sooner nor better.</p>

<p>For my own affairs, I am in a fair way of becoming as eminent as
Thomas &agrave; Kempis or John Bunyan; and you may expect henceforth to see
my birth-day inserted among the wonderful events, in the Poor Robin&#8217;s
and Aberdeen Almanacks, along with the Black Monday, and the battle of
Bothwell bridge.&mdash;My Lord Glencairn and the Dean of Faculty, Mr. H.
Erskine, have taken me under their wing; and by all probability I
shall soon be the tenth worthy, and the eighth wise man in the world.
Through my lord&#8217;s influence it is inserted in the records of the
Caledonian Hunt, that they universally, one and all, subscribe for the
second edition.&mdash;My subscription bills come out to-morrow, and you
shall have some of them next post.&mdash;I have met, in Mr. Dalrymple, of
Orangefield, what Solomon emphatically calls &#8220;a friend that sticketh
closer than a brother.&#8221;&mdash;The warmth with which he interests himself in
my affairs is of the same enthusiastic kind which you, Mr. Aiken, and

ten guineas for the Ayrshire bard with Mr. Sibbald, which I got.&mdash;I
since have discovered my generous unknown friend to be Patrick Miller,
Esq., brother to the Justice Clerk; and drank a glass of claret with
him, by invitation, at his own house, yesternight. I am nearly agreed
with Creech to print my book, and I suppose I will begin on Monday. I
will send a subscription bill or two, next post; when I intend writing
my first kind patron, Mr. Aiken. I saw his son to-day, and he is very

enclose you.&mdash;I was, Sir, when I was first honoured with your notice,
too obscure; now I tremble lest I should be ruined by being dragged
too suddenly into the glare of polite and learned observation.</p>

<p>I shall certainly, my ever honoured patron, write you an account of my

heavily solemn oath this!&mdash;I am, and have been, ever since I came to
Edinburgh, as unfit to write a letter of humour, as to write a
commentary on the Revelation of St. John the Divine, who was banished
to the Isle of Patmos, by the cruel and bloody Domitian, son to
Vespasian and brother to Titus, both emperors of Rome, and who was
himself an emperor, and raised the second or third persecution, I
forget which, against the Christians, and after throwing the said
Apostle John, brother to the Apostle James, commonly called James the
Greater, to distinguish him from another James, who was, on some
account or other, known by the name of James the Less&mdash;after throwing
him into a cauldron of boiling oil, from which he was miraculously
preserved, he banished the poor son of Zebedee to a desert island in
the Archipelago, where he was gifted with the second sight, and saw as
many wild beasts as I have seen since I came to Edinburgh; which, a
circumstance not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span> very uncommon in story-telling, brings me back to

<p class="sig7"><span class="smcap">My Lord,</span></p>

<p>As I have but slender pretensions to philosophy, I cannot rise to the
exalted ideas of a citizen of the world, but have all those national
prejudices, which I believe glow peculiarly strong in the breast of a
Scotchman. There is scarcely anything to which I am so feelingly alive
as the honour and welfare of my country: and, as a poet, I have no
higher enjoyment than singing her sons and daughters. Fate had cast my
station in the veriest shades of life; but never did a heart pant more
ardently than mine to be distinguished; though, till very lately, I
looked in vain on every side for a ray of light. It is easy then to
guess how much I was gratified with the countenance and approbation of
one of my country&#8217;s most illustrious sons, when Mr. Wauchope called on
me yesterday on the part of your lordship. Your munificence, my lord,
certainly deserves my very grateful acknowledgments; but your
patronage is a bounty peculiarly suited to my feelings. I am not
master enough of the etiquette of life to know, whether there be not
some impropriety in troubling your lordship with my thanks, but my
heart whispered me to do it. From the emotions of my inmost soul I do
it. Selfish ingratitude I hope I am incapable of; and mercenary
servility, I trust, I shall ever have so much honest pride as to
detest.</p>

<p>It gives me a secret comfort to observe in myself that I am not yet so
far gone as Willie Gaw&#8217;s Skate, &#8220;past redemption;&#8221; for I have still
this favourable symptom of grace, that when my conscience, as in the

ought to do, it teases me eternally till I do it.</p>

<p>I am still &#8220;dark as was Chaos&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> in respect to futurity. My generous
friend, Mr. Patrick Miller, has been talking with me about a lease of
some farm or other in an estate called Dalswinton, which he has lately
bought, near Dumfries. Some life-rented embittering recollections
whisper me that I will be happier anywhere than in my old
neighbourhood, but Mr. Miller is no judge of land; and though I dare
say he means to favour me, yet he may give me, in his opinion, an
advantageous bargain that may ruin me. I am to take a tour by Dumfries
as I return, and have promised to meet Mr. Miller on his lands some
time in May.</p>

<p>I went to a mason-lodge yesternight, where the most Worshipful Grand
Master Charters, and all the Grand Lodge of Scotland visited. The
meeting was numerous and elegant; all the different lodges about town
were present, in all their pomp. The Grand Master, who presided with
great solemnity and honour to himself as a gentleman and mason, among
other general toasts, gave &#8220;Caledonia, and Caledonia&#8217;s Bard, Brother
Burns,&#8221; which rung through the whole assembly with multiplied honours
and repeated acclamations. As I had no idea such a thing would happen,
I was downright thunderstruck, and, trembling in every nerve, made the
best return in my power. Just as I had finished, some of the grand
officers said, so loud that I could hear, with a most comforting
accent, &#8220;Very well indeed!&#8221; which set me something to rights again.</p>

<h3>TO MRS. DUNLOP.</h3>

<p>[The friendship of Mrs. Dunlop purified, while it strengthened the
national prejudices of Burns.]</p>

<p class="sig"><i>Edinburgh, 15th January</i>, 1787.</p>

<p class="sig7"><span class="smcap">Madam</span>,</p>

<p>Yours of the 9th current, which I am this moment honoured with, is a
deep reproach to me for ungrateful neglect. I will tell you the real
truth, for I am miserably awkward at a fib&mdash;I wished to have written
to Dr. Moore before I wrote to you; but though every day since I
received yours of December 30th, the idea, the wish to write to him
has constantly pressed on my thoughts, yet I could not for my soul set
about it. I know his fame and character, and I am one of &#8220;the sons of
little men.&#8221; To write him a mere matter-of-fact affair, like a
merchant&#8217;s order, would be disgracing the little character I have; and
to write the author of &#8220;The View of Society and Manners&#8221; a letter of
sentiment&mdash;I declare every artery runs cold at the thought. I shall
try, however, to write to him to-morrow or next day. His kind
interposition in my behalf I have already experienced, as a gentleman
waited on me the other day, on the part of Lord Eglintoun, with ten
guineas, by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span> way of subscription for two copies of my next edition.</p>

<p>The word you object to in the mention I have made of my glorious
countryman and your immortal ancestor, is indeed borrowed from
Thomson; but it does not strike me us an improper epithet. I
distrusted my own judgment on your finding fault with it, and applied
for the opinion of some of the literati here, who honour me with their
critical strictures, and they all allow it to be proper. The song you
ask I cannot recollect, and I have not a copy of it. I have not
composed anything on the great Wallace, except what you have, seen in
print; and the enclosed, which I will print in this edition. You will
see I have mentioned some others of the name. When I composed my
&#8220;Vision&#8221; long ago, I had attempted a description of Koyle, of which
the additional stanzas are a part, as it originally stood. My heart
glows with a wish to be able to do justice to the merits of the
&#8220;Saviour of his Country,&#8221; which sooner or later I shall at least
attempt.</p>

<p>You are afraid I shall grow intoxicated with my prosperity as a poet;
alas! Madam, I know myself and the world too well. I do not mean any
airs of affected modesty; I am willing to believe that my abilities
deserve some notice; but in a most enlightened, informed age and
nation, when poetry is and has been the study of man of the first
natural genius, aided with all the powers of polite learning, polite
books, and polite company&mdash;to be dragged forth to the full glare of
learned and polite observation, with all my imperfections of awkward
rusticity and crude unpolished ideas on my head&mdash;I assure you, Madam,
I do not dissemble when I tell you I tremble for the consequences. The
novelty of a poet in my obscure situation, without any of those
advantages which are reckoned necessary for that character, at least
at this time of day, has raised a partial tide of public notice which
has borne me to a height, where I am absolutely, feelingly certain, my
abilities are inadequate to support me; and too surely do I see that
time when the same tide will leave me, and recede, perhaps, as far
below the mark of truth. I do not say this in the ridiculous
affectation of self-abasement and modesty. I have studied myself, and
know what ground I occupy; and, however a friend or the world may
differ from me in that particular, I stand for my own opinion, in
silent resolve, with all the tenaciousness of property. I mention this
to you once for all to disburthen my mind, and I do not wish to hear
or say more about it&mdash;But,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;When proud fortune&#8217;s ebbing tide recedes,&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>you will bear me witness, that when my bubble of fame was at the
highest, I stood unintoxicated with the inebriating cup in my hand,
looking forward with rueful resolve to the hastening time, when the
blow of Calumny should dash it to the ground with all the eagerness of
vengeful triumph.</p>

<p>Your patronizing me and interesting yourself in my fame and character
as a poet, I rejoice in; it exalts me in my own idea; and whether you
can or cannot aid me in my subscription is a trifle. Has a paltry
subscription-bill any charms to the heart of a bard, compared with the
patronage of the descendant of the immortal Wallace?</p>

<h3>TO DR. MOORE.</h3>

<p>[Dr. Moore, the accomplished author of Zeluco and father of Sir John
Moore, interested himself in the fame and fortune of Burns, as soon as
the publication of his Poems made his name known to the world.]</p>

<p class="sig"><i>Edinburgh, Jan. 1787.</i></p>

<p class="sig7"><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>

<p>Mrs. Dunlop has been so kind as to send me extracts of letters she has
had from you, where you do the rustic bard the honour of noticing him
and his works. Those who have felt the anxieties and solicitudes of
authorship, can only know what pleasure it gives to be noticed in such
a manner, by judges of the first character. Your criticism, Sir, I
receive with reverence; only I am sorry they mostly came too late: a
peccant passage or two that I would certainly have altered, were gone
to the press.</p>

<p>The hope to be admired for ages, is, in by far the greater part of
those even who are authors of repute, an unsubstantial dream. For my
part, my first ambition was, and still my strongest wish is, to please
my compeers, the rustic inmates of the hamlet, while ever-changing
language and manners shall allow me to be relished and understood. I
am very willing to admit that I have some poetical abilities; and as
few, if any, writers, either moral or poetical, are intimately
acquainted with the classes of mankind<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span> among whom I have chiefly
mingled, I may have seen men and manners in a different phasis from
what is common, which may assist originality of thought. Still I know
very well the novelty of my character has by far the greatest share in
the learned and polite notice I have lately had; and in a language
where Pope and Churchill have raised the laugh, and Shenstone and Gray
drawn the tear; where Thomson and Beattie have painted the landscape,
and Lyttelton and Collins described the heart, I am not vain enough to
hope for distinguished poetic fame.</p>

<h3>TO THE REV. G. LAURIE,</h3>

<h4>NEWMILLS, NEAR KILMARNOCK.</h4>

<p>[It has been said in the Life of Burns, that for some time after he
went to Edinburgh, he did not visit Dr. Blacklock, whose high opinion
of his genius induced him to try his fortune in that city: it will be
seen by this letter that he had neglected also, for a time, at least,
to write to Dr. Laurie, who introduced him to the Doctor.]</p>

<p class="sig"><i>Edinburgh, Feb. 5th, 1787.</i></p>

<p class="sig7"><span class="smcap">Reverend and Dear Sir</span>,</p>

<p>When I look at the date of your kind letter, my heart reproaches me
severely with ingratitude in neglecting so long to answer it. I will
not trouble you with any account, by way of apology, of my hurried
life and distracted attention: do me the justice to believe that my
delay by no means proceeded from want of respect. I feel, and ever
shall feel for you the mingled sentiments of esteem for a friend and
reverence for a father.</p>

<p>I thank you, Sir, with all my soul for your friendly hints, though I
do not need them so much as my friends are apt to imagine. You are
dazzled with newspaper accounts and distant reports; but, in reality,
I have no great temptation to be intoxicated with the cup of
prosperity. Novelty may attract the attention of mankind awhile; to it
I owe my present &eacute;clat; but I see the time not far distant when the
popular tide which has borne me to a height of which I am, perhaps,
unworthy, shall recede with silent celerity, and leave me a barren
waste of sand, to descend at my leisure to my former station. I do not
say this in the affectation of modesty; I see the consequence is
unavoidable, and am prepared for it. I had been at a good deal of
pains to form a just, impartial estimate of my intellectual powers
before I came here; I have not added, since I came to Edinburgh,
anything to the account; and I trust I shall take every atom of it
back to my shades, the coverts of my unnoticed, early years.</p>

<p>In Dr. Blacklock, whom I see very often, I have found what I would
have expected in our friend, a clear head and an excellent heart.</p>

<p>By far the most agreeable hours I spend in Edinburgh must be placed to
the account of Miss Laurie and her piano-forte. I cannot help
repeating to you and Mrs. Laurie a compliment that Mr. Mackenzie, the
celebrated &#8220;Man of Feeling,&#8221; paid to Miss Laurie, the other night, at
the concert. I had come in at the interlude, and sat down by him till
I saw Miss Laurie in a seat not very distant, and went up to pay my
respects to her. On my return to Mr. Mackenzie he asked me who she
was; I told him &#8217;twas the daughter of a reverend friend of mine in the
west country. He returned, there was something very striking, to his
idea, in her appearance. On my desiring to know what it was, he was
pleased to say, &#8220;She has a great deal of the elegance of a well-bred
lady about her, with all the sweet simplicity of a country girl.&#8221;</p>

<p>My compliments to all the happy inmates of St. Margaret&#8217;s.</p>

<h3>TO DR. MOORE.</h3>

<p>[In the answer to this letter, Dr. Moore says that the poet was a
great favourite in his family, and that his youngest son, at
Winchester school, had translated part of &#8220;Halloween&#8221; into Latin
verse, for the benefit of his comrades.]</p>

<p class="sig"><i>Edinburgh, 15th February, 1787.</i></p>

<p class="sig7"><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>

<p>Pardon my seeming neglect in delaying so long to acknowledge the
honour you have done me, in your kind notice of me, January 23d. Not
many months ago I knew no other employment than following the plough,
nor could boast anything higher than a distant acquaintance with a
country clergyman. Mere greatness never embarrasses me; I have nothing
to ask from the great, and I do not fear their judgment: but genius,
polished by learning, and at its proper point of elevation in the eye
of the world, this of late I frequently meet with, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span> tremble at its
approach. I scorn the affectation of seeming modesty to cover
self-conceit. That I have some merit I do not deny; but I see with
frequent wringings of heart, that the novelty of my character, and the
honest national prejudice of my countrymen, have borne me to a height
altogether untenable to my abilities.</p>

<p>For the honour Miss Williams has done me, please, Sir, return her in
my name my most grateful thanks. I have more than once thought of
paying her in kind, but have hitherto quitted the idea in hopeless
despondency. I had never before heard of her; but the other day I got
her poems, which for several reasons, some belonging to the head, and
others the offspring of the heart, give me a great deal of pleasure. I
have little pretensions to critic lore; there are, I think, two
characteristic features in her poetry&mdash;the unfettered wild flight of
native genius, and the querulous sombre tenderness of &#8220;time-settled
sorrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>I only know what pleases me, often without being able to tell why.</p>

<h3>TO THE EARL OF GLENCAIRN.</h3>

<p>[The Earl of Glencairn seems to have refused, from motives of
delicacy, the request of the poet: the verses, long lost, were at last
found, and are now, through the kindness of my friend, Major James
Glencairn Burns, printed with the rest of his eminent father&#8217;s works.]</p>

<p class="sig"><i>Edinburgh, 1787</i></p>

<p class="sig7"><span class="smcap">My Lord</span>,</p>

<p>I wanted to purchase a profile of your lordship, which I was told was
to be got in town; but I am truly sorry to see that a blundering
painter has spoiled a &#8220;human face divine.&#8221; The enclosed stanzas I
intended to have written below a picture or profile of your lordship,
could I have been so happy as to procure one with anything of a
likeness.</p>

<p>As I will soon return to my shades, I wanted to have something like a
material object for my gratitude; I wanted to have it in my power to
say to a friend, there is my noble patron, my generous benefactor.
Allow me, my lord, to publish these verses. I conjure your lordship,
by the honest throe of gratitude, by the generous wish of benevolence,
by all the powers and feelings which compose the magnanimous mind, do
not deny me this petition. I owe much to your lordship: and, what has
not in some other instances always been the case with me, the weight
of the obligation is a pleasing load. I trust I have a heart as
independent as your lordship&#8217;s, than which I can say nothing more; and
I would not be beholden to favours that would crucify my feelings.
Your dignified character in life, and manner of supporting that
character, are flattering to my pride; and I would be jealous of the
purity of my grateful attachment, where I was under the patronage of
one of the much favoured sons of fortune.</p>

<p>Almost every poet has celebrated his patrons, particularly when they
were names dear to fame, and illustrious in their country; allow me,
then, my lord, if you think the verses have intrinsic merit, to tell
the world how much I have the honour to be,</p>

<p class="sig3">Your lordship&#8217;s highly indebted, </p>
<p class="sig4">And ever grateful humble servant,</p>

<h3>TO THE EARL OF BUCHAN.</h3>

<p>[The Earl of Buchan, a man of talent, but more than tolerably vain,
advised Burns to visit the battle-fields and scenes celebrated in song
on the Scottish border, with the hope, perhaps, that he would drop a
few of his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span> happy verses in Dryburgh Abbey, the residence of his
lordship.]</p>

<p class="sig7"><span class="smcap">My Lord</span>,</p>

<p>The honour your lordship has done me, by your notice and advice in
yours of the 1st instant, I shall ever gratefully remember:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;Praise from thy lips, &#8217;tis mine with joy to boast,<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>Your lordship touches the darling chord of my heart when you advise me
to fire my muse at Scottish story and Scotch scenes. I wish for
nothing more than to make a leisurely pilgrimage through my native
country; to sit and muse on those once hard-contended fields, where
Caledonia, rejoicing, saw her bloody lion borne through broken ranks
to victory and fame; and, catching the inspiration, to pour the
deathless names in song. But, my lord, in the midst of these
enthusiastic reveries, a long-visaged, dry, moral-looking phantom
strides across my imagination, and pronounces these emphatic words:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;I, Wisdom, dwell with Prudence. Friend, I do not come to open the
ill-closed wounds of your follies and misfortunes, merely to give you
pain: I wish through these wounds to imprint a lasting lesson on your
heart. I will not mention how many of my salutary advices you have
despised: I have given you line upon line and precept upon precept;
and while I was chalking out to you the straight way to wealth and
character, with audacious effrontery you have zigzagged across the
path, contemning me to my face: you know the consequences. It is not
yet three months since home was so hot for you that you were on the
wing for the western shore of the Atlantic, not to make a fortune, but
to hide your misfortune.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now that your dear-loved Scotia puts it in your power to return to
the situation of your forefathers, will you follow these will-o&#8217;-wisp
meteors of fancy and whim, till they bring you once more to the brink
of ruin? I grant that the utmost ground you can occupy is but half a
step from the veriest poverty; but still it is half a step from it. If
all that I can urge be ineffectual, let her who seldom calls to you in
vain, let the call of pride prevail with you. You know how you feel at
the iron gripe of ruthless oppression: you know how you bear the
galling sneer of contumelious greatness. I hold you out the
conveniences, the comforts of life, independence, and character, on
the one hand; I tender you civility, dependence, and wretchedness, on
the other. I will not insult your understanding by bidding you make a
choice.&#8221;</p>

<p>This, my lord, is unanswerable. I must return to my humble station,
and woo my rustic muse in my wonted way at the plough-tail. Still, my
lord, while the drops of life warm my heart, gratitude to that
dear-loved country in which I boast my birth, and gratitude to those
her distinguished sons who have honoured me so much with their
patronage and approbation, shall, while stealing through my humble
shades; ever distend my bosom, and at times, as now, draw forth the
swelling tear.</p>

<p>I was equally surprised and pleased at your letter, though I dare say
you will think by my delaying so long to write to you that I am so
drowned in the intoxication of good fortune as to be indifferent to
old, and once dear connexions. The truth is, I was determined to write
a good letter, full of argument, amplification, erudition, and, as
Bayes says, <i>all that.</i> I thought of it, and thought of it, and, by my
soul, I could not; and, lest you should mistake the cause of my
silence, I just sit down to tell you so. Don&#8217;t give yourself credit,
though, that the strength of your logic scares me: the truth is, I
never mean to meet you on that ground at all. You have shown me one
thing which was to be demonstrated: that strong pride of reasoning,
with a little affectation of singularity, may mislead the best of
hearts. I likewise, since you and I were first acquainted, in the
pride of despising old woman&#8217;s stories, ventured in &#8220;the daring path
Spinosa trod;&#8221; but experience of the weakness, not the strength of
human powers, made me glad to grasp at revealed religion.</p>

<p class="sig7"><span class="smcap">My dear Sir,</span></p>

<p>You may think, and too justly, that I am a selfish, ungrateful fellow,
having received so many repeated instances of kindness from you, and
yet never putting pen to paper to say thank you; but if you knew what
a devil of a life my conscience has led me on that account, your good
heart would think yourself too much avenged. By the bye, there is
nothing in the whole frame of man which seems to be so unaccountable
as that thing called conscience. Had the troublesome yelping cur
powers efficient to prevent a mischief, he might be of use; but at the
beginning of the business, his feeble efforts are to the workings of
passion as the infant frosts of an autumnal morning to the unclouded
fervour of the rising sun: and no sooner are the tumultuous doings of
the wicked deed over, than, amidst the bitter native consequences of
folly, in the very vortex of our horrors, up starts conscience, and
harrows us with the feelings of the damned.</p>

<p>I have enclosed you, by way of expiation, some verse and prose, that,
if they merit a place in your truly entertaining miscellany, you are
welcome to. The prose extract is literally as Mr. Sprott sent it me.</p>

<p>I read your letter with watery eyes. A little, very little while ago,
I had scarce a friend but the stubborn pride of my own bosom: now I am
distinguished, patronized, befriended by you. Your friendly advices, I
will not give them the cold name of criticisms, I receive with
reverence. I have made some small alterations in what I before had
printed. I have the advice of some very judicious friends among the
literati here, but with them I sometimes find it necessary to claim
the privilege of thinking for myself. The noble Karl of Glencairn, to
whom I owe more than to any man, does me the honor of giving me his
strictures: his hints, with respect to impropriety or indelicacy, I
follow implicitly.</p>

<p>You kindly interest yourself in my future views and prospects; there I
can give you no light. It is all</p>

<p>The appellation of a Scottish bard, is by far my highest pride; to
continue to deserve it is my most exalted ambition. Scottish scenes
and Scottish story are the themes I could wish to sing. I have no
dearer aim than to have it in my power, unplagued with the routine of
business, for which heaven knows I am unfit enough, to make leisurely
pilgrimages through Caledonia; to sit on the fields of her battles; to
wander on the romantic banks of her rivers; and to muse by the stately
towers or venerable ruins, once the honoured abodes of her heroes.</p>

<p>But these are all Utopian thoughts: I have dallied long enough with
life; &#8217;tis time to be in earnest. I have a fond, an aged mother to
care for: and some other bosom ties perhaps equally tender. Where the
individual only suffers by the consequences of his own
thoughtlessness, indolence, or folly, he may be excusable; nay,
shining abilities, and some of the nobler virtues, may half sanctify a
heedless character; but where God and nature have intrusted the
welfare of others to his care; where the trust is sacred, and the ties
are dear, that man must be far gone in selfishness, or strangely lost
to reflection, whom these connexions will not rouse to exertion.</p>

<p>I guess that I shall clear between two and three hundred pounds by my
authorship; with that sum I intend, so far as I may be said to have
any intention, to return to my old acquaintance, the plough, and if I
can meet with a lease by which I can live, to commence farmer. I do
not intend to give up poetry; being bred to labour, secures me
independence, and the muses are my chief, sometimes have been my only
enjoyment. If my practice second my resolution, I shall have
principally at heart the serious business of life; but while following
my plough, or building up my shocks, I shall cast a leisure glance to
that dear, that only feature of my character, which gave me the notice
of my country, and the patronage of a Wallace.</p>

<p>Thus, honoured Madam, I have given you the bard, his situation, and
his views, native as they are in his own bosom.</p>

<p>I received the books, and sent the one you mentioned to Mrs. Dunlop. I

gratitude. I thank you, Sir, for the honour you have done me; and to

supreme gratification.</p>

a few pilgrimages over some of the classic ground of Caledonia, Cowden

intimacies and friendships here, but I am afraid they are all of too

am not very amenable to counsel. Poets, much my superiors, have so
flattered those who possessed the adventitious qualities of wealth and
power, that I am determined to flatter no created being, either in
prose or verse.</p>

<p>I set as little by princes, lords, clergy, critics, &amp;c., as all these
respective gentry do by my bardship. I know what I may expect from the
word, by and by&mdash;illiberal abuse, and perhaps contemptuous neglect.</p>

<p>I am happy, Madam, that some of my own favourite pieces are
distinguished by your particular approbation. For my &#8220;Dream,&#8221; which

<p>I leave Edinburgh to-morrow morning, but could not go without
troubling you with half a line, sincerely to thank you for the
kindness, patronage, and friendship you have shown me. I often felt
the embarrassment of my singular situation; drawn forth from the
veriest shades of life to the glare of remark; and honoured by the
notice of those illustrious names of my country whose works, while
they are applauded to the end of time, will ever instruct and mend the
heart. However the meteor-like novelty of my appearance in the world
might attract notice, and honour me with the acquaintance of the
permanent lights of genius and literature, those who are truly
benefactors of the immortal nature of man, I knew very well that my
utmost merit was far unequal to the task of preserving that character
when once the novelty was over; I have made up my mind that abuse, or
almost even neglect, will not surprise me in my quarters.</p>

<p>In justice to Spenser, I must acknowledge that there is scarcely a
poet in the language could have been a more agreeable present to me;
and in justice to you, allow me to say, Sir, that I have not met with
a man in Edinburgh to whom I would so willingly have been indebted for
the gift. The tattered rhymes I herewith present you, and the handsome
volumes of Spenser for which I am so much indebted to your goodness,
may perhaps be not in proportion to one another; but be that as it
may, my gift, though far less valuable, is as sincere a mark of esteem
as yours.</p>

<p>The time is approaching when I shall return to my shades; and I am
afraid my numerous Edinburgh friendships are of so tender a
construction, that they will not bear carriage with me. Yours is one
of the few that I could wish of a more robust constitution. It is
indeed very probable that when I leave this city, we part never more
to meet in this sublunary sphere; but I have a strong fancy that in
some future eccentric planet, the comet of happier systems than any
with which astronomy is yet acquainted, you and I, among the harum

<p>I date this from Mauchline, where I arrived on Friday even last. I
slept at John Dow&#8217;s, and called for my daughter. Mr. Hamilton and your
family; your mother, sister, and brother; my quondam Eliza, &amp;c., all
well. If anything had been wanting to disgust me completely at
Armour&#8217;s family, their mean, servile compliance would have done it.</p>

<p>Give me a spirit like my favourite hero, Milton&#8217;s Satan:</p>

<p>I cannot settle to my mind.&mdash;Farming, the only thing of which I know
anything, and heaven above knows but little do I understand of that, I
cannot, dare not risk on farms as they are. If I do not fix I will go

<h3>TO WILLIAM NICOL, ESQ.</h3>

<p>[The charm which Dumfries threw over the poet, seems to have dissolved

with little respect of either place or people.]</p>

<p class="sig"><i>Mauchline, June 18, 1787.</i></p>

<p class="sig7"><span class="smcap">My dear Friend,</span></p>

<p>I am now arrived safe in my native country, after a very agreeable
jaunt, and have the pleasure to find all my friends well. I
breakfasted with your gray-headed, reverend friend, Mr. Smith; and was
highly pleased both with the cordial welcome he gave me, and his most
excellent appearance and sterling good sense.</p>

<p>I have been with Mr. Miller at Dalswinton, and am to meet him again in
August. From my view of the lands, and his reception of my bardship,
my hopes in that business are rather mended; but still they are but
slender.</p>

<p>I am quite charmed with Dumfries folks&mdash;Mr. Burnside, the clergyman,
in particular, is a man whom I shall ever gratefully remember; and his
wife, Gude forgie me! I had almost broke the tenth commandment on her
account. Simplicity, elegance, good sense, sweetness of disposition,
good humour, kind hospitality are the constituents of her manner and
heart; in short&mdash;but if I say one word more about her, I shall be
directly in love with her.</p>

<p>I never, my friend, thought mankind very capable of anything generous;
but the stateliness of the patricians in Edinburgh, and the servility
of my plebeian brethren (who perhaps formerly eyed me askance) since I
returned home, have nearly put me out of conceit altogether with my
species. I have bought a pocket Milton, which I carry perpetually
about with me, in order to study the sentiments&mdash;the dauntless
magnanimity, the intrepid, unyielding independence, the desperate
daring, and noble defiance of hardship, in that great personage,
<span class="smcap">Satan</span>. &#8217;Tis true, I have just now a little cash; but I am
afraid the star that hitherto has shed its malignant, purpose-blasting
rays full in my zenith; that noxious planet so baneful in its
influences to the rhyming tribe, I much dread it is not yet beneath my
horizon.&mdash;Misfortune dodges the path of human life; the poetic mind
finds itself miserably deranged in, and unfit for the walks of
business; add to all, that thoughtless follies and hare-brained whims,
like so many <i>ignes fatui</i>, eternally diverging from the right line of
sober discretion, sparkle with step-bewitching blaze in the
idly-gazing eyes of the poor heedless bard, till, pop, &#8220;he falls like
Lucifer, never to hope again.&#8221; God grant this may be an unreal picture
with respect to me! but should it not, I have very little dependence
on mankind. I will close my letter with this tribute my heart bids me
pay you&mdash;the many ties of acquaintance and friendship which I have, or
think I have in life, I have felt along the lines, and, damn them,
they are almost all of them of such frail contexture, that I am sure
they would not stand the breath of the least adverse breeze of
fortune; but from you, my ever dear Sir, I look with confidence for
the apostolic love that shall wait on me &#8220;through good report and bad
report&#8221;&mdash;the love which Solomon emphatically says &#8220;is strong as
death.&#8221; My compliments to Mrs. Nicol, and all the circle of our common
friends.</p>

<p class="sig"><i>June 30, 1787.</i></p>

<p class="sig7"><span class="smcap">My dear Friend,</span></p>

<p>On our return, at a Highland gentleman&#8217;s hospitable mansion, we fell
in with a merry party, and danced till the ladies left us, at three in
the morning. Our dancing was none of the French or English insipid
formal movements; the ladies sung Scotch songs like angels, at
intervals; then we flew at Bab at the Bowster, Tullochgorum, Loch
Erroch Side, &amp;c., like midges sporting in the mottie sun, or craws
prognosticating a storm in a hairst day.&mdash;When the dear lasses left
us, we ranged round the bowl till the good-fellow hour of six; except
a few minutes that we went out to pay our devotions to the glorious
lamp of day peering over the towering top of Benlomond. We all
kneeled; our worthy landlord&#8217;s son held the bowl; each man a full
glass in his hand; and I, as priest, repeated some rhyming nonsense,
like Thomas-a-Rhymer&#8217;s prophecies I suppose.&mdash;After a small
refreshment of the gifts of Somnus, we proceeded to spend the day on
Lochlomond, and reach Dumbarton in the evening. We dined at another
good fellow&#8217;s house, and consequently, pushed the bottle; when we went
out to mount our horses, we found ourselves &#8220;No vera fou but gaylie
yet.&#8221; My two friends and I rode soberly down the Loch side, till by
came a Highlandman at the gallop, on a tolerably good horse, but which
had never known the ornaments of iron or leather. We scorned to be
out-galloped by a Highlandman, so off we started, whip and spur. My
companions, though seemingly gaily mounted, fell sadly astern; but my
old mare, Jenny Geddes, one of the Rosinante family, she strained past
the Highlandman in spite of all his efforts with the hair halter; just
as I was passing him, Donald wheeled his horse, as if to cross before
me to mar my progress, when down came his horse, and threw his rider&#8217;s
breekless a&mdash;&mdash;e in a clipt hedge; and down came Jenny Geddes over
all, and my bardship between her and the Highlandman&#8217;s horse. Jenny
Geddes trode over me with such cautious reverence, that matters were
not so bad as might well have been expected; so I came off with a few
cuts and bruises, and a thorough resolution to be a pattern of
sobriety for the future.</p>

<p>I have yet fixed on nothing with respect to the serious business of
life. I am, just as usual, a rhyming, mason-making, raking, aimless,
idle fellow. However, I shall somewhere have a farm soon. I was going
to say, a wife too; but that must never be my blessed lot. I am but a
younger son of the house of Parnassus, and like other younger sons of
great families, I may intrigue, if I choose to run all risks, but must
not marry.</p>

<p>I am afraid I have almost ruined one source, the principal one,
indeed, of my former happiness; that eternal propensity I always had
to fall in love. My heart no more glows with feverish rapture. I have
no paradisaical evening interviews, stolen from the restless cares and
prying inhabitants of this weary world. I have only * * * *. This last
is one of your distant acquaintances, has a fine figure, and elegant
manners; and in the train of some great folks whom you know, has seen,
the politest quarters in Europe. I do like her a good deal; but what
piques me is her conduct at the commencement of our acquaintance. I
frequently visited her when I was in &mdash;&mdash;, and after passing regularly
the intermediate degrees between the distant formal bow and the
familiar grasp round the waist, I ventured, in my careless way, to
talk of friendship in rather ambiguous terms; and after her return
to &mdash;&mdash;, I wrote to her in the same style. Miss, construing my words
farther I suppose than even I intended, flew off in a tangent of
female dignity and reserve, like a mounting lark in an April morning;
and wrote me an answer which measured me out very completely what an
immense way I had to travel before I could reach the climate of her
favour. But I am an old hawk at the sport, and wrote her such a cool,
deliberate, prudent reply, as brought my bird from her aerial
towerings, pop, down at my foot, like Corporal Trim&#8217;s hat.</p>

<p>As for the rest of my acts, and my wars, and all my wise sayings, and
why my mare was called Jenny Geddes, they shall be recorded in a few
weeks hence at Linlithgow, in the chronicles of your memory, by</p>

<p class="sig7"><span class="smcap">My dear Richmond,</span></p>

<p>I am all impatience to hear of your fate since the old confounder of
right and wrong has turned you out of place, by his journey to answer
his indictment at the bar of the other world. He will find the
practice of the court so different from the practice in which he has
for so many years been thoroughly hackneyed, that his friends, if he
had any connexions truly of that kind, which I rather doubt, may well
tremble for his sake. His chicane, his left-handed wisdom, which stood
so firmly by him, to such good purpose, here, like other accomplices
in robbery and plunder, will, now the piratical business is blown, in
all probability turn the king&#8217;s evidences, and then the devil&#8217;s
bagpiper will touch him off &#8220;Bundle and go!&#8221;</p>

<p>If he has left you any legacy, I beg your pardon for all this; if not,
I know you will swear to every word I said about him.</p>

<p>I have lately been rambling over by Dumbarton and Inverary, and
running a drunken race on the side of Loch Lomond with a wild
Highlandman; his horse, which had never known the ornaments of iron or
leather, zigzagged across before my old spavin&#8217;d hunter, whose name is
Jenny Geddes, and down came the Highlandman, horse and all, and down
came Jenny and my bardship; so I have got such a skinful of bruises
and wounds, that I shall be at least four weeks before I dare venture
on my journey to Edinburgh.</p>

<p>Not one new thing under the sun has happened in Mauchline since you
left it. I hope this will find you as comfortably situated as
formerly, or, if heaven pleases, more so; but, at all events, I trust
you will let me know of course how matters stand with you, well or
ill. &#8217;Tis but poor consolation to tell the world when matters go
wrong; but you know very well your connexion and mine stands on a

whom I can talk nonsense without forfeiting some degree of his esteem.
Now, to one like me, who never cares for speaking anything else but
nonsense, such a friend as you is an invaluable treasure. I was never
a rogue, but have been a fool all my life; and, in spite of all my
endeavours, I see now plainly that I shall never be wise. Now it
rejoices my heart to have met with such a fellow as you, who, though
you are not just such a hopeless fool as I, yet I trust you will never
listen so much to the temptations of the devil as to grow so very wise
that you will in the least disrespect an honest follow because he is a

<p class="sig7"><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>

<p>For some months past I have been rambling over the country, but I am
now confined with some lingering complaints, originating, as I take
it, in the stomach. To divert my spirits a little in this miserable
fog of ennui, I have taken a whim to give you a history of myself. My
name has made some little noise in this country; you have done me the
honour to interest yourself very warmly in my behalf; and I think a
faithful account of what character of a man I am, and how I came by
that character, may perhaps amuse you in an idle moment. I will give
you an honest narrative, though I know it will be often at my own
expense; for I assure you, Sir, I have, like Solomon, whose character,
excepting in the trifling affair of wisdom, I sometimes think I
resemble,&mdash;I have, I say, like him turned my eyes to behold madness
and folly, and like him, too, frequently shaken hands with their
intoxicating friendship.&mdash;After you have perused these pages, should
you think them trifling and impertinent, I only beg leave to tell you,
that the poor author wrote them under some twitching qualms of
conscience, arising from a suspicion that he was doing what he ought
not to do; a predicament he has more than once been in before.</p>

<p>I have not the most distant pretensions to assume that character which
the pye-coated guardians of escutcheons call a gentleman. When at
Edinburgh last winter, I got acquainted in the herald&#8217;s office; and,
looking through that granary of honours, I there found almost every
name in the kingdom; but for me,</p>

<p>Gules, purpure, argent, &amp;c., quite disowned me.</p>

<p>My father was of the north of Scotland, the son of a farmer, and was
thrown by early misfortunes on the world at large; where, after many
years&#8217; wanderings and sojournings, he picked up a pretty large
quantity of observation and experience, to which I am indebted for
most of my little pretensions to wisdom&mdash;I have met with few who
understood men, their manners, and their ways, equal to him; but
stubborn, ungainly integrity, and headlong, ungovernable irascibility,
are disqualifying circumstances; consequently, I was born a very poor
man&#8217;s son. For the first six or seven years of my life, my father was
gardener to a worthy gentleman of small estate in the neighbourhood of
Ayr. Had he continued in that station I must have marched off to be
one of the little underlings about a farm-house; but it was his
dearest wish and prayer to have it in his power to keep his children
under his own eye, till they could discern between good and evil; so,
with the assistance of his generous master, my father ventured on a
small farm on his estate. At those years, I was by no means a
favourite with anybody. I was a good deal noted for a retentive
memory, a stubborn sturdy something in my disposition, and an
enthusiastic idiot<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> piety. I say idiot piety, because I was then
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>but a child. Though it cost the schoolmaster some thrashings, I made
an excellent English, scholar; and by the time I was ten or eleven
years of age, I was a critic in substantives, verbs, and particles. In
my infant and boyish days, too, I owed much to an old woman who
resided in the family, remarkable for her ignorance, credulity, and
superstition. She had, I suppose, the largest collection in the
country of tales and songs concerning devils, ghosts, fairies,
brownies, witches, warlocks, spunkies, kelpies, elf-candles,
dead-lights, wraiths, apparitions, cantraips, giants, enchanted towers,
dragons, and other trumpery. This cultivated the latent seeds of
poetry; but had so strong an effect on my imagination, that to this
hour, in my nocturnal rambles, I sometimes keep a sharp look out in
suspicions places; and though nobody can be more sceptical than I am
in such matters, yet it often takes an effort of philosophy to shake
off these idle terrors. The earliest composition that I recollect
taking pleasure in, was The Vision of Mirza, and a hymn of Addison&#8217;s
beginning, &#8220;How are thy servants blest, O Lord!&#8221; I particularly
remember one half-stanza which was music to my boyish ear&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;For though in dreadful whirls we hung<br /></span>
<span class="i2">High on the broken wave&mdash;&#8220;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>I met with these pieces in Mason&#8217;s English Collection, one of my
school-books. The first two books I ever read in private, and which
gave me more pleasure than any two books I ever read since, were The
Life of Hannibal, and The History of Sir William Wallace. Hannibal
gave my young ideas such a turn, that I used to strut in raptures up
and down after the recruiting drum and bag-pipe, and wish myself tall
enough to be a soldier; while the story of Wallace poured a Scottish
prejudice into my veins, which will boil along there till the
flood-gates of life shut in eternal rest.</p>

<p>Polemical divinity about this time was putting the country half mad,
and I, ambitious of shining in conversation parties on Sundays,
between sermons, at funerals, &amp;c., used a few years afterwards to
puzzle Calvinism with so much heat and indiscretion, that I raised a
hue and cry of heresy against me, which has not ceased to this hour.</p>

<p>My vicinity to Ayr was of some advantage to me. My social disposition,
when not checked by some modifications of spirited pride, was like our
catechism definition of infinitude, without bounds or limits. I formed
several connexions with other younkers, who possessed superior
advantages; the youngling actors who were busy in the rehearsal of
parts, in which they were shortly to appear on the stage of life,
where, alas! I was destined to drudge behind the scenes. It is not
commonly at this green age, that our young gentry have a just sense of
the immense distance between them and their ragged playfellows. It
takes a few dashes into the world, to give the young great man that
proper, decent, unnoticing disregard for the poor, insignificant
stupid devils, the mechanics and peasantry around him, who were,
perhaps, born in the same village. My young superiors never insulted
the clouterly appearance of my plough-boy carcase, the two extremes
of which were often exposed to all the inclemencies of all the
seasons. They would give me stray volumes of books; among them, even
then, I could pick up some observations, and one, whose heart, I am
sure, not even the &#8220;Munny Begum&#8221; scenes have tainted, helped me to a
little French. Parting with these my young friends and benefactors, as
they occasionally went off for the East or West Indies, was often to
me a sore affliction; but I was soon called to more serious evils. My
father&#8217;s generous master died! the farm proved a ruinous bargain; and
to clench the misfortune, we fell into the hands of a factor, who sat
for the picture I have drawn of one in my tale of &#8220;The Twa Dogs.&#8221; My
father was advanced in life when he married; I was the eldest of seven
children, and he, worn out by early hardships, was unfit for labour.
My father&#8217;s spirit was soon irritated, but not easily broken. There
was a freedom in his lease in two years more, and to weather these two
years, we retrenched our expenses. We lived very poorly: I was a
dexterous ploughman for my age; and the next eldest to me was a
brother (Gilbert), who could drive the plough very well, and help me
to thrash the corn. A novel-writer might, perhaps, have viewed these
scenes with some satisfaction, but so did not I; my indignation yet
boils at the recollection of the scoundrel factor&#8217;s insolent
threatening letters, which used to set us all in tears.</p>

<p>This kind of life&mdash;the cheerless gloom of a hermit, with the unceasing
moil of a galley-slave, brought me to my sixteenth year; a little
before which period I first committed the sin of rhyme. You know our
country custom of cou<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>pling a man and woman together as partners in
the labours of harvest. In my fifteenth autumn, my partner was a
bewitching creature, a year younger than myself. My scarcity of
English denies me the power of doing her justice in that language, but
you know the Scottish idiom: she was a &#8220;bonnie, sweet, sonsie lass.&#8221;
In short, she, altogether unwittingly to herself, initiated me in that
delicious passion, which, in spite of acid disappointment, gin-horse
prudence, and bookworm philosophy, I hold to be the first of human
joys, our dearest blessing here below! How she caught the contagion I
cannot tell; you medical people talk much of infection from breathing
the same air, the touch, &amp;c.; but I never expressly said I loved
her.&mdash;Indeed, I did not know myself why I liked so much to loiter
behind with her, when returning in the evening from our labours; why
the tones of her voice made my heart-strings thrill like an &AElig;olian
harp; and particularly why my pulse beat such a furious ratan, when I
looked and fingered over her little hand to pick out the cruel
nettle-stings and thistles. Among her other love-inspiring qualities,
she sung sweetly; and it was her favourite reel to which I attempted
giving an embodied vehicle in ryhme. I was not so presumptuous as to
imagine that I could make verses like printed ones, composed by men
who had Greek and Latin; but my girl sung a song which was said to be
composed by a small country laird&#8217;s son, on one of his father&#8217;s maids,
with whom he was in love; and I saw no reason why I might not rhyme as
well as he; for excepting that he could smear sheep, and cast peats,
his father living in the moorlands, he had no more scholar-craft than
myself.</p>

<p>Thus with me began love and poetry; which at times have been my only,
and till within the last twelve months, have been my highest
enjoyment. My father struggled on till he reached the freedom in his
lease, when he entered on a larger farm, about ten miles farther in
the country. The nature of the bargain he made was such as to throw a
little ready money into his hands at the commencement of his lease,
otherwise the affair would have been impracticable. For four years we
lived comfortably here, but a difference commencing between him and
his landlord as to terms, after three years tossing and whirling in
the vortex of litigation, my father was just saved from the horrors of
a jail, by a consumption, which, after two years&#8217; promises, kindly
stepped in, and carried him away, to where the wicked cease from
troubling, and where the weary are at rest!</p>

<p>It is during the time that we lived on this farm that my little story
is most eventful. I was, at the beginning of this period, perhaps, the
most ungainly awkward boy in the parish&mdash;no <i>solitaire</i> was less
acquainted with the ways of the world. What I knew of ancient story
was gathered from Salmon&#8217;s and Guthrie&#8217;s Geographical Grammars; and
the ideas I had formed of modern manners, of literature, and
criticism, I got from the Spectator. These, with Pope&#8217;s Works, some
Plays of Shakspeare, Tull and Dickson on Agriculture, the Pantheon,
Locke&#8217;s Essay on the Human Understanding, Stackhouse&#8217;s History of the
Bible, Justice&#8217;s British Gardener&#8217;s Directory, Boyle&#8217;s Lectures, Allan
Ramsay&#8217;s Works, Taylor&#8217;s Scripture Doctrine of Original Sin, A Select
Collection of English Songs, and Hervey&#8217;s Meditations, had formed the
whole of my reading. The collection of Songs was my <i>vade mecum.</i> I
pored over them, driving my cart, or walking to labour, song by song,
verse by verse; carefully noting the true tender, or sublime, from
affectation and fustian. I am convinced I owe to this practice much of
my critic craft, such as it is.</p>

<p>In my seventeenth year, to give my manners a brush, I went to a
country dancing-school. My father had an unaccountable antipathy
against these meetings, and my going was, what to this moment I
repent, in opposition to his wishes. My father, as I said before, was
subject to strong passions; from that instance of disobedience in me,
he took a sort of dislike to me, which, I believe, was one cause of
the dissipation which marked my succeeding years. I say dissipation,
comparatively with the strictness, and sobriety, and regularity of
Presbyterian country life; for though the will-o&#8217;-wisp meteors of
thoughtless whim were almost the sole lights of my path, yet early
ingrained piety and virtue kept me for several years afterwards within
the line of innocence. The great misfortune of my life was to want an
aim. I had felt early some stirrings of ambition, but they were the
blind gropings of Homer&#8217;s Cyclops round the walls of his cave. I saw
my father&#8217;s situation entailed on me perpetual labour. The only two
openings by which I could enter the temple of fortune were the gate of
niggardly economy, or the path of little chican<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>ing bargain-making.
The first is so contracted an aperture I never could squeeze myself
into it&mdash;the last I always hated&mdash;there was contamination in the very
entrance! Thus abandoned of aim or view in life, with a strong
appetite for sociability, as well from native hilarity as from a pride
of observation and remark; a constitutional melancholy or
hypochondriasm that made me fly solitude; add to these incentives to
social life, my reputation for bookish knowledge, a certain wild
logical talent, and a strength of thought, something like the
rudiments of good sense; and it will not seem surprising that I was
generally a welcome guest where I visited, or any great wonder that
always, where two or three met together, there was I among them. But
far beyond all other impulses of my heart, was <i>un penchant &agrave; l&#8217;
adorable moiti&eacute; du genre humain.</i> My heart was completely tinder, and
was eternally lighted up by some goddess or other; and, as in every
other warfare in this world, my fortune was various; sometimes I was
received with favour, and sometimes I was mortified with a repulse. At
the plough, scythe, or reap-hook, I feared no competitor, and thus I
set absolute want at defiance; and as I never cared farther for my
labours than while I was in actual exercise, I spent the evenings in
the way after my own heart. A country lad seldom carries on a love
adventure without an assisting confidant. I possessed a curiosity,
zeal, and intrepid dexterity that recommended me as a proper second on
these occasions; and I dare say, I felt as much pleasure in being in
the secret of half the loves of the parish of Tarbolton, as ever did
statesman in knowing the intrigues of half the courts of Europe. The
very goose feather in my hand seems to know instinctively the
well-worn path of my imagination, the favourite theme of my song; and
is with difficulty restrained from giving you a couple of paragraphs
on the love-adventures of my compeers, the humble inmates of the
farm-house and cottage; but the grave sons of science, ambition, or
avarice baptize these things by the name of follies. To the sons and
daughters of labour and poverty they are matters of the most serious
nature: to them the ardent hope, the stolen interview, the tender
farewell, are the greatest and most delicious parts of their
enjoyments.</p>

<p>Another circumstance in my life which made some alteration in my mind
and manners, was, that I spent my nineteenth summer on a smuggling
coast, a good distance from home, at a noted school to learn
mensuration, surveying, dialling, &amp;c., in which I made a pretty good
progress. But I made a greater progress in the knowledge of mankind.
The contraband trade was at that time very successful, and it
sometimes happened to me to fall in with those who carried it on.
Scenes of swaggering riot and roaring dissipation were, till this
time, new to me; but I was no enemy to social life. Here, though I
learnt to fill my glass, and to mix without fear in a drunken
squabble, yet I went on with a high hand with my geometry, till the
sun entered Virgo, a month which is always a carnival in my bosom,
when a charming fillette, who lived next door to the school, overset
my trigonometry, and set me off at a tangent from the spheres of my
studies. I, however, struggled on with my sines and co-sines for a few
days more; but stepping into the garden one charming noon to take the
sun&#8217;s altitude, there I met my angel,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">&#8220;Like Proserpine gathering flowers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Herself a fairer flower&mdash;&#8220;<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It was in vain to think of doing any more good at school. The
remaining week I stayed I did nothing but craze the faculties of my
soul about her, or steal out to meet her; and the two last nights of
my stay in the country, had sleep been a mortal sin, the image of this
modest and innocent girl had kept me guiltless.</p>

<p>I returned home very considerably improved. My reading was enlarged
with the very important addition of Thomson&#8217;s and Shenstone&#8217;s works; I
had seen human nature in a new phasis; and I engaged several of my
school-fellows to keep up a literary correspondence with me. This
improved me in composition. I had met with a collection of letters by
the wits of Queen Anne&#8217;s reign, and I pored over them most devoutly. I
kept copies of any of my own letters that pleased me, and a comparison
between them and the composition of most of my correspondents
flattered my vanity. I carried this whim so far, that though I hid not
three-farthings&#8217; worth of business in the world, yet almost every post
brought me as many letters as if I had been a broad plodding son of
the day-book and ledger.</p>

<p>My life flowed on much in the same course <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span> till my twenty-third year. <i>Vive l&#8217;amour, et vive la bagatelle</i>, were
my sole principles of action. The addition of two more authors to my
library gave me great pleasure; Sterne and Mackenzie&mdash;Tristram Shandy
and the Man of Feeling were my bosom favourites. Poesy was still a
darling walk for my mind, but it was only indulged in according to the
humour of the hour. I had usually half a dozen or more pieces on hand;
I took up one or other, as it suited the momentary tone of the mind,
and dismissed the work as it bordered on fatigue. My passions, when
once lighted up, raged like so many devils, till they got vent in
rhyme; and then the conning over my verses, like a spell, soothed all
into quiet! None of the rhymes of those days are in print, except
&#8220;Winter, a dirge,&#8221; the eldest of my printed pieces; &#8220;The Death of poor
Maillie,&#8221; &#8220;John Barleycorn,&#8221; and songs first, second, and third. Song
second was the ebullition of that passion which ended the
forementioned school-business.</p>

<p>My twenty-third year was to me an important &aelig;ra. Partly through whim,
and partly that I wished to set about doing something in life, I
joined a flax-dresser in a neighboring town (Irvine) to learn his
trade. This was an unlucky affair. My * * * and to finish the whole,
as we were giving a welcome carousal to the new year, the shop took
fire and burnt to ashes, and I was left, like a true poet, not worth a
sixpence.</p>

<p>I was obliged to give up this scheme; the clouds of misfortune were
gathering thick round my father&#8217;s head; and, what was worst of all, he
was visibly far gone in a consumption; and to crown my distresses, a
<i>belle fille</i>, whom I adored, and who had pledged her soul to meet me
in the field of matrimony, jilted me, with peculiar circumstances of
mortification. The finishing evil that brought up the rear of this
infernal file, was my constitutional melancholy being increased to
such a degree, that for three months I was in a state of mind scarcely
to be envied by the hopeless wretches who have got their
mittimus&mdash;depart from me, ye cursed!</p>

<p>From this adventure I learned something of a town life; but the
principal thing which gave my mind a turn, was a friendship I formed
with a young fellow, a very noble character, but a hapless son of
misfortune. He was the son of a simple mechanic; but a great man in
the neighbourhood taking him under his patronage, gave him a genteel
education, with a view of bettering his situation in life. The patron
dying just as he was ready to launch out into the world, the poor
fellow in despair went to sea; where, after a variety of good and
ill-fortune, a little before I was acquainted with him he had been set
on shore by an American privateer, on the wild coast of Connaught,
stripped of everything. I cannot quit this poor fellow&#8217;s story without
adding, that he is at this time master of a large West-Indiaman
belonging to the Thames.</p>

<p>His mind was fraught with independence, magnanimity, and every manly
virtue. I loved and admired him to a degree of enthusiasm, and of
course strove to imitate him. In some measure I succeeded; I had pride
before, but he taught it to flow in proper channels. His knowledge of
the world was vastly superior to mine, and I was all attention to
learn. He was the only man I ever saw who was a greater fool than
myself where woman was the presiding star; but he spoke of illicit
love with the levity of a sailor, which hitherto I had regarded with
horror. Here his friendship did me a mischief, and the consequence
was, that soon after I resumed the plough, I wrote the &#8220;Poet&#8217;s
Welcome.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> My reading only increased while in this town by two stray
volumes of Pamela, and one of Ferdinand Count Fathom, which gave me
some idea of novels. Rhyme, except some religious pieces that are in
print, I had given up; but meeting with Fergusson&#8217;s Scottish Poems, I
strung anew my wildly-sounding lyre with emulating vigour. When my
father died, his all went among the hell-hounds that growl in the
kennel of justice; but we made a shift to collect a little money in
the family amongst us, with which, to keep us together, my brother and
I took a neighbouring farm. My brother wanted my hair-brained
imagination, as well as my social and amorous madness; but in good
sense, and every sober qualification, he was far my superior.</p>

<p>I entered on this farm with a full resolution, &#8220;come, go to, I will be
wise!&#8221; I read farming books, I calculated crops; I attended markets;
and in short, in spite of the devil, and the world, and the flesh, I
believe I should have been a wise man; but the first year, from
unfortunately buying bad seed, the second from a late harvest, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span> we lost half our crops. This overset all my wisdom, and I returned,
&#8220;like the dog to his vomit, and the sow that was washed, to her
wallowing in the mire.&#8221;</p>

<p>I now began to be known in the neighbourhood as a maker of rhymes. The
first of my poetic offspring that saw the light, was a burlesque
lamentation on a quarrel between two reverend Calvinists, both of them
<i>dramatis person&aelig;</i> in &#8220;Holy Fair.&#8221; I had a notion myself that the
piece had some merit; but, to prevent the worst, I gave a copy of it
to a friend, who was very fond of such things, and told him that I
could not guess who was the author of it, but that I thought it pretty
clever. With a certain description of the clergy, as well as laity, it
met with a roar of applause. &#8220;Holy Willie&#8217;s Prayer&#8221; next made its
appearance, and alarmed the kirk-session so much, that they held
several meetings to look over their spiritual artillery, if haply any
of it might be pointed against profane rhymers. Unluckily for me, my
wanderings led me on another side, within point-blank shot of their
heaviest metal. This is the unfortunate story that gave rise to my
printed poem, &#8220;The Lament.&#8221; This was a most melancholy affair, which I
cannot yet bear to reflect on, and had very nearly given me one or two
of the principal qualifications for a place among those who have lost
the chart, and mistaken the reckoning of rationality. I gave up my
part of the farm to my brother; in truth it was only nominally mine;
and made what little preparation was in my power for Jamaica. But,
before leaving my native country for ever, I resolved to publish my
poems. I weighed my productions as impartially as was in my power; I
thought they had merit; and it was a delicious idea that I should be
called a clever fellow, even though it should never reach my ears&mdash;a
poor negro-driver&mdash;or perhaps a victim to that inhospitable clime, and
gone to the world of spirits! I can truly say, that <i>pauvre inconnu</i>
as I then was, I had pretty nearly as high an idea of myself and of my
works as I have at this moment, when the public has decided in their
favour. It ever was my opinion that the mistakes and blunders, both in
a rational and religious point of view, of which we see thousands
daily guilty, are owing to their ignorance of themselves.&mdash;To know
myself had been all along my constant study. I weighed myself alone; I
balanced myself with others; I watched every means of information, to
see how much ground I occupied as a man and as a poet; I studied
assiduously Nature&#8217;s design in my formation&mdash;where the lights and
shades in my character were intended. I was pretty confident my poems
would meet with some applause; but, at the worst, the roar of the
Atlantic would deafen the voice of censure, and the novelty of West
Indian scenes make me forget neglect. I threw off six hundred copies,
of which I had got subscriptions for about three hundred and
fifty.&mdash;My vanity was highly gratified by the reception I met with
from the public; and besides I pocketed, all expenses deducted, nearly
twenty pounds. This sum came very seasonably, as I was thinking of
indenting myself, for want of money to procure my passage. As soon as
I was master of nine guineas, the price of wafting me to the torrid
zone, I took a steerage passage in the first ship that was to sail
from the Clyde, for</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;Hungry ruin had me in the wind.&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>I had been for some days skulking from covert to covert, under all the
terrors of a jail; as some ill-advised people had uncoupled the
merciless pack of the law at my heels. I had taken the last farewell
of my few friends; my chest was on the road to Greenock; I had
composed the last song I should ever measure in Caledonia&mdash;&#8220;The gloomy
night is gathering fast,&#8221; when a letter from Dr. Blacklock to a friend
of mine, overthrew all my schemes, by opening new prospects to my
poetic ambition. The doctor belonged to a set of critics for whose
applause I had not dared to hope. His opinion, that I would meet with
encouragement in Edinburgh for a second edition, fired me so much,
that away I posted for that city, without a single acquaintance, or a
single letter of introduction. The baneful star that had so long shed
its blasting influence in my zenith, for once made a revolution to the
nadir; and a kind Providence placed me under the patronage of one of
the noblest of men, the Earl of Glencairn. <i>Oublie-moi, grand Dieu, si
jamais je l&#8217;oublie!</i></p>

<p>I need relate no farther. At Edinburgh I was in a new world; I mingled
among many classes of men, but all of them new to me, and I was all
attention to &#8220;catch&#8221; the characters and &#8220;the manners living as they
rise.&#8221; Whether I have profited, time will show.</p>

requisite in Edinburgh, and I set out to-morrow.</p>

<p>From henceforth, my dear Sir, I am determined to set off with my
letters like the periodical writers, viz. prefix a kind of text,
quoted from some classic of undoubted authority, such as the author of
the immortal piece, of which my text is part. What I have to say on my
text is exhausted in a letter which I wrote you the other day, before
I had the pleasure of receiving yours from Inverkeithing; and sure
never was anything more lucky, as I have but the time to write this,
that Mr. Nicol, on the opposite side of the table, takes to correct a
proof-sheet of a thesis. They are gabbling Latin so loud that I cannot
hear what my own soul is saying in my own skull, so I must just give
you a matter-of-fact sentence or two, and end, if time permit, with a
verse de rei generatione. To-morrow I leave Edinburgh in a chaise;
Nicol thinks it more comfortable than horseback, to which I say, Amen;
so Jenny Geddes goes home to Ayrshire, to use a phrase of my mother&#8217;s,
wi&#8217; her finger in her mouth.</p>

<p>Now for a modest verse of classical authority:</p>

time before the 1st of September, direct to Inverness, to be left at
the post-office till called for; the next week at Aberdeen, the next

<p class="sig7"><span class="smcap">My Dear Sir</span>,</p>

<p>I intended to have written you from Edinburgh, and now write you from
Stirling to make an excuse. Here am I, on my way to Inverness, with a
truly original, but very worthy man, a Mr. Nicol, one of the masters
of the High-school, in Edinburgh. I left Auld Reekie yesterday
morning, and have passed, besides by-excursions, Linlithgow,
Borrowstouness, Falkirk, and here am I undoubtedly. This morning I
knelt at the tomb of Sir John the Graham, the gallant friend of the
immortal Wallace; and two hours ago I said a fervent prayer, for Old
Caledonia, over the hole in a blue whinstone, where Robert de Bruce
fixed his royal standard on the banks of Bannockburn; and just now,
from Stirling Castle, I have seen by the setting sun the glorious
prospect of the windings of Forth through the rich carse of Stirling,
and skirting the equally rich carse of Falkirk. The crops are very
strong, but so very late, that there is no harvest, except a ridge or
two perhaps in ten miles, all the way I have travelled from Edinburgh.</p>

<p>I left Andrew Bruce and family all well. I will be at least three
weeks in making my tour, as I shall return by the coast, and have many
people to call for.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span></p>

<p>My best compliments to Charles, our dear kinsman and fellow-saint; and
Messrs. W. and H. Parkers. I hope Hughoc is going on and prospering
with God and Miss M&#8217;Causlin.</p>

<p>If I could think on anything sprightly, I should let you hear every
other post; but a dull, matter-of-fact business, like this scrawl, the
less and seldomer one writes, the better.</p>

<p>Among other matters-of-fact I shall add this, that I am and ever shall

<h3>TO GAVIN HAMILTON, ESQ.</h3>

<p>[It is supposed that the warmth of the lover came in this letter to
the aid of the imagination of the poet, in his account of Charlotte
Hamilton.]</p>

<p class="sig"><i>Stirling, 28th August</i>, 1787.</p>

<p class="sig7"><span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,</p>

<p>Here am I on my way to Inverness. I have rambled over the rich,
fertile carses of Falkirk and Sterling, and am delighted with their
appearance: richly waving crops of wheat, barley, &amp;c., but no harvest
at all yet, except, in one or two places, an old wife&#8217;s ridge.
Yesterday morning I rode from this town up the meandering Devon&#8217;s
banks, to pay my respects to some Ayrshire folks at Harvieston. After
breakfast, we made a party to go and see the famous Caudron-linn, a
remarkable cascade in the Devon, about five miles above Harvieston;
and after spending one of the most pleasant days I ever had in my
life, I returned to Stirling in the evening. They are a family, Sir,
though I had not any prior tie; though they had not been the brother
and sisters of a certain generous friend of mine, I would never forget
them. I am told you have not seen them these several years, so you can
have very little idea of what these young folks are now. Your brother
is as tall as you are, but slender rather than otherwise; and I have
the satisfaction to inform you that he is getting the better of those
consumptive symptoms which I suppose you know were threatening him.
His make, and particularly his manner, resemble you, but he will still
have a finer face. (I put in the word <i>still</i> to please Mrs.
Hamilton.) Good sense, modesty, and at the same time a just idea of
that respect that man owes to man, and has a right in his turn to
exact, are striking features in his character; and, what with me is
the Alpha and the Omega, he has a heart that might adorn the breast of
a poet! Grace has a good figure, and the look of health and
cheerfulness, but nothing else remarkable in her person. I scarcely
ever saw so striking a likeness as is between her and your little
Beenie; the mouth and chin particularly. She is reserved at first; but
as we grew better acquainted, I was delighted with the native
frankness of her manner, and the sterling sense of her observation. Of
Charlotte I cannot speak in common terms of admiration: she is not
only beautiful but lovely. Her form is elegant; her features not
regular, but they have the smile of sweetness and the settled
complacency of good nature in the highest degree: and her complexion,
now that she has happily recovered her wonted health, is equal to Miss
Burnet&#8217;s. After the exercise of our riding to the Falls, Charlotte was
exactly Dr. Donne&#8217;s mistress:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&#8220;Her pure and eloquent blood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Spoke in her cheeks, and so distinctly wrought,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That one would almost say her body thought.&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Her eyes are fascinating; at once expressive of good sense,
tenderness, and a noble mind.</p>

<p>I do not give you all this account, my good Sir, to flatter you. I
mean it to reproach you. Such relations the first peer in the realm
might own with pride; then why do you not keep up more correspondence
with these so amiable young folks? I had a thousand questions to
answer about you. I had to describe the little ones with the
minuteness of anatomy. They were highly delighted when I told them
that John was so good a boy, and so fine a scholar, and that Willie
was going on still very pretty; but I have it in commission to tell
her from them that beauty is a poor silly bauble without she be good.
Miss Chalmers I had left in Edinburgh, but I had the pleasure of
meeting Mrs. Chalmers, only Lady Mackenzie being rather a little
alarmingly ill of a sore throat somewhat marred our enjoyment.</p>

<p>I shall not be in Ayrshire for four weeks. My most respectful
compliments to Mrs. Hamilton, Miss Kennedy, and Doctor Mackenzie. I
shall probably write him from some stage or other.</p>

<p class="sig4">I am ever, Sir,</p>

<p class="sig5">Yours most gratefully,</p>

<h3>TO MR. WALKER,</h3>

<h4>BLAIR OF ATHOLE.</h4>

<p>[Professor Walker was a native of Ayrshire, and an accomplished
scholar; he saw Burns often in Edinburgh; he saw him at the Earl of
Athol&#8217;s on the Bruar; he visited him too at Dumfries; and after the
copyright of Currie&#8217;s edition of the poet&#8217;s works expired, he wrote,
with much taste and feeling his life anew, and edited his works&mdash;what
passed under his own observation he related with truth and ease.]</p>

<p class="sig"><i>Inverness, 5th September</i>, 1787.</p>

<p class="sig7"><span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,</p>

<p>I have just time to write the foregoing,<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> and to tell you that it
was (at least most part of it) the effusion of an half-hour I spent at
Bruar. I do not mean it was extempore, for I have endeavoured to brush
it up as well as Mr. Nicol&#8217;s chat and the jogging of the chaise would
allow. It eases my heart a good deal, as rhyme is the coin with which
a poet pays his debts of honour or gratitude. What I owe to the noble
family of Athol, of the first kind, I shall ever proudly boast; what I
owe of the last, so help me God in my hour of need! I shall never
forget.</p>

<p>The &#8220;little angel-band!&#8221; I declare I prayed for them very sincerely
to-day at the Fall of Fyers. I shall never forget the fine
family-piece I saw at Blair; the amiable, the truly noble duchess,
with her smiling little seraph in her lap, at the head of the table;
the lovely &#8220;olive plants,&#8221; as the Hebrew bard finely says, round the
happy mother: the beautiful Mrs. G&mdash;&mdash;; the lovely sweet Miss C., &amp;c.
I wish I had the powers of Guido to do them justice! My Lord Duke&#8217;s
kind hospitality&mdash;markedly kind indeed. Mr. Graham of Fintray&#8217;s charms
of conversation&mdash;Sir W. Murray&#8217;s friendship. In short, the
recollection of all that polite, agreeable company raises an honest
glow in my bosom.</p>

<h3>TO MR. GILBERT BURNS.</h3>

<p>[The letters of Robert to Gilbert are neither many nor important: the
latter was a calm, considerate, sensible man, with nothing poetic in
his composition: he died lately, much and widely respected.]</p>

<p class="sig"><i>Edinburgh, 17th September, 1787.</i></p>

<p class="sig7"><span class="smcap">My dear Brother</span>,</p>

<p>I arrived here safe yesterday evening, after a tour of twenty-two
days, and travelling near six hundred miles, windings included. My
farthest stretch was about ten miles beyond Inverness. I went through
the heart of the Highlands by Crieff, Taymouth, the famous seat of
Lord Breadalbane, down the Tay, among cascades and druidical circles
of stones, to Dunkeld, a seat of the Duke of Athol; thence across the
Tay, and up one of his tributary streams to Blair of Athole, another
of the duke&#8217;s seats, where I had the honour of spending nearly two
days with his grace and family; thence many miles through a wild
country, among cliffs gray with eternal snows and gloomy savage glens,
till I crossed Spey and went down the stream through Strathspey, so
famous in Scottish music; Badenoch, &amp;c., till I reached Grant Castle,
where I spent half a day with Sir James Grant and family; and then
crossed the country for Fort George, but called by the way at Cawdor,
the ancient seat of Macbeth; there I saw the identical bed, in which
tradition says king Duncan was murdered: lastly, from Fort George to
Inverness.</p>

<p>I returned by the coast, through Nairn, Forres, and so on, to
Aberdeen, thence to Stonehive, where James Burness, from Montrose, met
me by appointment. I spent two days among our relations, and found our
aunts, Jean and Isabel, still alive, and hale old women. John Cairn,
though born the same year with our father, walks as vigorously as I
can: they have had several letters from his son in New York. William
Brand is likewise a stout old fellow; but further particulars I delay
till I see you, which will be in two or three weeks. The rest of my
stages are not worth rehearsing: warm as I was from
Ossian&#8217;s country, where I had seen his very grave, what cared I for
fishing-towns or fertile carses? I slept at the famous Brodie of
Brodie&#8217;s one night, and dined at Gordon Castle next day, with the
duke, duchess and family. I am thinking to cause my old mare to meet
me, by means of John Ronald, at Glasgow; but you shall hear farther
from me before I leave Edinburgh. My duty and many compliments from
the north to my mother; and my brotherly compliments to the rest. I
have been trying for a berth for William, but am not likely to be
successful. Farewell.</p>

<h3>TO MISS MARGARET CHALMERS.</h3>

<h4>(NOW MRS. HAY.)</h4>

<p>[To Margaret Chalmers, the youngest daughter of James Chalmers, Esq.,
of Fingland, it is said that Burns confided his affection to Charlotte
Hamilton: his letters to Miss Chalmers, like those to Mrs. Dunlop, are
distinguished for their good sense and delicacy as well as freedom.]</p>

<p class="sig"><i>Sept. 26, 1787.</i></p>

<p>I send Charlotte the first number of the songs; I would not wait for
the second number; I hate delays in little marks of friendship, as I
hate dissimulation in the language of the heart. I am determined to
pay Charlotte a poetic compliment, if I could hit on some glorious old
Scotch air, in number second.<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> You will see a small attempt on a
shred of paper in the book: but though Dr. Blacklock commended it very
highly, I am not just satisfied with it myself. I intend to make it a
description of some kind: the whining cant of love, except in real
passion, and by a masterly hand, is to me as insufferable as the
preaching cant of old Father Smeaton, whig-minister at Kilmaurs.
Darts, flames, cupids, loves, graces, and all that farrago, are just a
Mauchline * * * * a senseless rabble.</p>

<p>I got an excellent poetic epistle yesternight from the old, venerable
author of &#8220;Tullochgorum,&#8221; &#8220;John of Badenyon,&#8221; &amp;c. I suppose you know
he is a clergyman. It is by far the finest poetic compliment I ever
got. I will send you a copy of it.</p>

<p>I go on Thursday or Friday to Dumfries, to wait on Mr. Miller about
his farms.&mdash;Do tell that to Lady Mackenzie, that she may give me
credit for a little wisdom. &#8220;I Wisdom dwell with Prudence.&#8221; What a
blessed fire-side! How happy should I be to pass a winter evening
under their venerable roof! and smoke a pipe of tobacco, or drink
water-gruel with them! What solemn, lengthened, laughter-quashing
gravity of phiz! What sage remarks on the good-for-nothing sons and
daughters of indiscretion and folly! And what frugal lessons, as we
straitened the fire-side circle, on the uses of the poker and tongs!</p>

<p>Miss N. is very well, and begs to be remembered in the old way to you.
I used all my eloquence, all the persuasive flourishes of the hand,
and heart-melting modulation of periods in my power, to urge her out
to Harvieston, but all in vain. My rhetoric seems quite to have lost
its effect on the lovely half of mankind. I have seen the day&mdash;but
that is a &#8220;tale of other years.&#8221;&mdash;In my conscience I believe that my
heart has been so oft on fire that it is absolutely vitrified. I look
on the sex with something like the admiration with which I regard the
starry sky in a frosty December night. I admire the beauty of the
Creator&#8217;s workmanship; I am charmed with the wild but graceful
eccentricity of their motions, and&mdash;wish them good night. I mean this
with respect to a certain passion <i>dont j&#8217;ai eu l&#8217;honneur d&#8217;&ecirc;tre un
miserable esclave</i>: as for friendship, you and Charlotte have given me
pleasure, permanent pleasure, &#8220;which the world cannot give, nor take
away,&#8221; I hope; and which will outlast the heavens and the earth.</p>

Charlotte Hamilton, was enclosed in the following letter.]</p>

<p class="sig"><i>Without date.</i></p>

<p>I have been at Dumfries, and at one visit more shall be decided about
a farm in that country. I am rather hopeless in it; but as my brother
is an excellent farmer, and is, besides, an exceedingly prudent, sober
man (qualities which are only a younger brother&#8217;s fortune in our
family), I am determined, if my Dumfries business fail me, to return
into partnership with him, and at our leisure take another farm in the
neighbourhood.</p>

<p>I assure you I look for high compliments from you and Charlotte on
this very sage instance of my unfathomable, incomprehensible wisdom.
Talking of Charlotte, I must tell her that I have, to the best of my
power, paid her a poetic compliment, now completed. The air is
admirable: true old Highland. It was the tune of a Gaelic song, which
an Inverness lady sung me when I was there; and I was so charmed with
it that I begged her to write me a set of it from her singing; for it
had never been set before. I am fixed that it shall go in Johnson&#8217;s
next number; so Charlotte and you need not spend your precious time in
contradicting me. I won&#8217;t say the poetry is first-rate; though I am
convinced it is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span> very well; and, what is not always the case with
compliments to ladies, it is not only sincere, but just.</p>

<h3>TO JAMES HOY, ESQ.</h3>

<h4>GORDON CASTLE</h4>

<p>[James Hoy, librarian of Gordon Castle, was, it is said, the gentleman
whom his grace of Gordon sent with a message inviting in vain that
&#8220;obstinate son of Latin prose,&#8221; Nicol, to stop and enjoy himself.]</p>

<p class="sig"><i>Edinburgh, 20th October</i>, 1787.</p>

<p class="sig7"><span class="smcap">Sir,</span></p>

<p>I will defend my conduct in giving you this trouble, on the best of
Christian principles&mdash;&#8220;Whatsoever ye would that men should do unto
you, do ye even so unto them.&#8221;&mdash;I shall certainly, among my legacies,
leave my latest curse to that unlucky predicament which hurried&mdash;tore
me away from Castle Gordon. May that obstinate son of Latin prose
[Nicol] be curst to Scotch mile periods, and damned to seven league
paragraphs; while Declension and Conjugation, Gender, Number, and
Time, under the ragged banners of Dissonance and Disarrangement,
eternally rank against him in hostile array.</p>

<p>Allow me, Sir, to strengthen the small claim I have to your
acquaintance, by the following request. An engraver, James Johnson, in
Edinburgh, has, not from mercenary views, but from an honest, Scotch
enthusiasm, set about collecting all our native songs and setting them
to music; particularly those that have never been set before. Clarke,
the well known musician, presides over the musical arrangement, and
Drs. Beattie and Blacklock, Mr. Tytler, of Woodhouselee, and your
humble servant to the utmost of his small power, assist in collecting
the old poetry, or sometimes for a fine air make a stanza, when it has
no words. The brats, too tedious to mention, claim a parental pang
from my bardship. I suppose it will appear in Johnson&#8217;s second
number&mdash;the first was published before my acquaintance with him. My
request is&mdash;&#8220;Cauld Kail in Aberdeen,&#8221; is one intended for this number,
and I beg a copy of his Grace of Gordon&#8217;s words to it, which you were
so kind as to repeat to me. You may be sure we won&#8217;t prefix the
author&#8217;s name, except you like, though I look on it as no small merit
to this work that the names of many of the authors of our old Scotch
songs, names almost forgotten, will be inserted.</p>

<p>I do not well know where to write to you&mdash;I rather write at you; but
if you will be so obliging, immediately on receipt of this, as to
write me a few lines, I shall perhaps pay you in kind, though not in
quality. Johnson&#8217;s terms are:&mdash;each number a handsome pocket volume,
to consist at least of a hundred Scotch songs, with basses for the
harpsichord, &amp;c. The price to subscribers 5s.; to non-subscribers 6s.
He will have three numbers I conjecture.</p>

<p>My direction for two or three weeks will be at Mr. William
Cruikshank&#8217;s, St. James&#8217;s-square, New-town, Edinburgh.</p>

<p>[The songs of &#8220;Tullochgorum,&#8221; and &#8220;John of Badenyon,&#8221; have made the

<p class="sig"><i>Edinburgh, October 25,</i> 1787.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Reverend and Venerable Sir,</span></p>

<p>Accept, in plain dull prose, my most sincere thanks for the best
poetical compliment I ever received. I assure you, Sir, as a poet, you
have conjured up an airy demon of vanity in my fancy, which the best
abilities in your other capacity would be ill able to lay. I regret,
and while I live I shall regret, that when I was in the north, I had
not the pleasure of paying a younger brother&#8217;s dutiful respect to the
author of the best Scotch song ever Scotland saw&mdash;&#8220;Tullochgorum&#8217;s my
delight!&#8221; The world may think slightingly of the craft of song-making,
if they please, but, as Job says&mdash;&#8220;Oh! that mine adversary had written
a book!&#8221;&mdash;let them try. There is a certain something in the old Scotch
songs, a wild happiness of thought and expression, which peculiarly
marks them, not only from English songs, but also from the modern
efforts of song-wrights in our native manner and language. The only
remains of this enchantment, these spells of the imagination, rests
with you. Our true brother, Ross of Lochlee, was likewise &#8220;owre
cannie&#8221;&mdash;a &#8220;wild warlock&#8221;&mdash;but now he sings among the &#8220;sons of the
morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>I have often wished, and will certainly endea<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>vour to form a kind of
common acquaintance among all the genuine sons of Caledonian song. The
world, busy in low prosaic pursuits, may overlook most of us; but
&#8220;reverence thyself.&#8221; The world is not our <i>peers</i>, so we challenge the
jury. We can lash that world, and find ourselves a very great source
of amusement and happiness independent of that world.</p>

<p>There is a work going on in Edinburgh, just now, which claims your
best assistance. An engraver in this town has set about collecting and
publishing all the Scotch songs, with the music, that can be found.
Songs in the English language, if by Scotchmen, are admitted, but the
music must all be Scotch. Drs. Beattie and Blacklock are lending a
hand, and the first musician in town presides over that department. I
have been absolutely crazed about it, collecting old stanzas, and
every information respecting their origin, authors, &amp;c. &amp;c. This last
is but a very fragment business; but at the end of his second
number&mdash;the first is already published&mdash;a small account will be given
of the authors, particularly to preserve those of latter times. Your
three songs, &#8220;Tullochgorum,&#8221; &#8220;John of Badenyon,&#8221; and &#8220;Ewie wi&#8217; the
crookit horn,&#8221; go in this second number. I was determined, before I
got your letter, to write you, begging that you would let me know
where the editions of these pieces may be found, as you would wish
them to continue in future times: and if you would be so kind to this
undertaking as send any songs, of your own or others, that you would
think proper to publish, your name will be inserted among the other
authors,&mdash;&#8220;Nill ye, will ye.&#8221; One half of Scotland already give your
songs to other authors. Paper is done. I beg to hear from you; the
sooner the better, as I leave Edinburgh in a fortnight or three
weeks.&mdash;</p>

<p class="sig3">I am,</p>

<p class="sig2">With the warmest sincerity, Sir,</p>

<p class="sig4">Your obliged humble servant,&mdash;R. B</p>

<h3>TO JAMES HOY, ESQ.</h3>

<h4>AT GORDON CASTLE, FOCHABERS.</h4>

<p>[In singleness of heart and simplicity of manners James Hoy is said,
by one who knew him well, to have rivalled Dominie Sampson: his love
of learning and his scorn of wealth are still remembered to his
honour.]</p>

<p class="sig"><i>Edinburgh, 6th November</i>, 1787.</p>

<p class="sig7"><span class="smcap">Dear Sir,</span></p>

<p>I would have wrote you immediately on receipt of your kind letter, but
a mixed impulse of gratitude and esteem whispered me that I ought to
send you something by way of return. When a poet owes anything,
particularly when he is indebted for good offices, the payment that
usually recurs to him&mdash;the only coin indeed in which he probably is
conversant&mdash;is rhyme. Johnson sends the books by the fly, as directed,
and begs me to enclose his most grateful thanks: my return I intended
should have been one or two poetic bagatelles which the world have not
seen, or, perhaps, for obvious reasons, cannot see. These I shall send
you before I leave Edinburgh. They may make you laugh a little, which,
on the whole, is no bad way of spending one&#8217;s precious hours and still
more precious breath: at any rate, they will be, though a small, yet a
very sincere mark of my respectful esteem for a gentleman whose
further acquaintance I should look upon as a peculiar obligation.</p>

<p>The duke&#8217;s song, independent totally of his dukeship, charms me. There
is I know not what of wild happiness of thought and expression
peculiarly beautiful in the old Scottish song style, of which his
Grace, old venerable Skinner, the author of &#8220;Tullochgorum,&#8221; &amp;c., and
the late Ross, at Lochlee, of true Scottish poetic memory, are the
only modern instances that I recollect, since Ramsay with his
contemporaries, and poor Bob Fergusson, went to the world of deathless
existence and truly immortal song. The mob of mankind, that
many-headed beast, would laugh at so serious a speech about an old
song; but as Job says, &#8220;O that mine adversary had written a book!&#8221;
Those who think that composing a Scotch song is a trifling
business&mdash;let them try.</p>

<p>I wish my Lord Duke would pay a proper attention to the Christian
admonition&mdash;&#8220;Hide not your candle under a bushel,&#8221; but &#8220;let your light
shine before men.&#8221; I could name half a dozen dukes that I guess are a
devilish deal worse employed: nay, I question if there are half a
dozen better: perhaps there are not half that scanty number whom
Heaven has favoured with the tuneful, happy, and, I will say, glorious
gift.</p>

<h3>TO THE EARL OF GLENCAIRN.</h3>

<p>[The views of Burns were always humble: he regarded a place in the
excise as a thing worthy of paying court for, both in verse and
prose.]</p>

<p class="sig"><i>Edinburgh</i>, 1787.</p>

<p class="sig7"><span class="smcap">My Lord,</span></p>

<p>I know your lordship will disapprove of my ideas in a request I am
going to make to you; but I have weighed, long and seriously weighed,
my situation, my hopes and turn of mind, and am fully fixed to my
scheme if I can possibly effectuate it. I wish to get into the Excise;
I am told that your lordship&#8217;s interest will easily procure me the
grant from the commissioners; and your lordship&#8217;s patronage and
goodness, which have already rescued me from obscurity, wretchedness,
and exile, embolden me to ask that interest. You have likewise put it
in my power to save the little tie of home that sheltered an aged
mother, two brothers, and three sisters from destruction. There, my
lord, you have bound me over to the highest gratitude.</p>

<p>My brother&#8217;s farm is but a wretched lease, but I think he will
probably weather out the remaining seven years of it; and after the
assistance which I have given and will give him, to keep the family
together, I think, by my guess, I shall have rather better than two
hundred pounds, and instead of seeking, what is almost impossible at
present to find, a farm that I can certainly live by, with so small a
stock, I shall lodge this sum in a banking-house, a sacred deposit,
expecting only the calls of uncommon distress or necessitous old age.</p>

<p>These, my lord, are my views: I have resolved from the maturest
deliberation; and now I am fixed, I shall leave no stone unturned to
carry my resolve into execution. Your lordship&#8217;s patronage is the
strength of my hopes; nor have I yet applied to anybody else. Indeed
my heart sinks within me at the idea of applying to any other of the
great who have honoured me with their countenance. I am ill qualified
to dog the heels of greatness with the impertinence of solicitation,
and tremble nearly as much at the thought of the cold promise as the
cold denial; but to your lordship I have not only the honour, the
comfort, but the pleasure of being</p>

<p class="sig3">Your lordship&#8217;s much obliged</p>

<p class="sig4">And deeply indebted humble servant,</p>

<h3>TO JAMES DALRYMPLE, ESQ.</h3>

<h4>ORANGEFIELD.</h4>

<p>[James Dalrymple, Esq., of Orangefield, was a gentleman of birth and
poetic tastes&mdash;he interested himself in the fortunes of Burns.]</p>

<p class="sig"><i>Edinburgh</i>, 1787.</p>

<p class="sig7"><span class="smcap">Dear Sir,</span></p>

<p>I suppose the devil is so elated with his success with you that he is
determined by a <i>coup de main</i> to complete his purposes on you all at
once, in making you a poet. I broke open the letter you sent me;
hummed over the rhymes; and, as I saw they were extempore, said to
myself, they were very well; but when I saw at the bottom a name that
I shall ever value with grateful respect, &#8220;I gapit wide, but naething
spak.&#8221; I was nearly as much struck as the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span> friends of Job, of
affliction-bearing memory, when they sat down with him seven days and
seven nights, and spake not a word.</p>

<p>I am naturally of a superstitious cast, and as soon as my
wonder-scared imagination regained its consciousness, and resumed its
functions, I cast about what this mania of yours might portend. My
foreboding ideas had the wide stretch of possibility; and several
events, great in their magnitude, and important in their consequences,
occurred to my fancy. The downfall of the conclave, or the crushing of
the Cork rumps; a ducal coronet to Lord George Gordon and the
Protestant interest; or St. Peter&#8217;s keys to * * * * * *.</p>

<p>You want to know how I come on. I am just in <i>statu quo</i>, or, not to
insult a gentleman with my Latin, in &#8220;auld use and wont.&#8221; The noble
Earl of Glencairn took me by the hand to-day, and interested himself
in my concerns, with a goodness like that benevolent Being, whose
image he so richly bears. He is a stronger proof of the immortality of
the soul, than any that philosophy ever produced. A mind like his can
never die. Let the worshipful squire H. L., or the reverend Mass J. M.
go into their primitive nothing. At best, they are but ill-digested
lumps of chaos, only one of them strongly tinged with bituminous
particles and sulphureous effluvia. But my noble patron, eternal as
the heroic swell of magnanimity, and the generous throb of
benevolence, shall look on with princely eye at &#8220;the war of elements,
the wreck of matter, and the crush of worlds.&#8221;</p>

<p>I have one vexatious fault to the kindly-welcome, well-filled sheet
which I owe to your and Charlotte&#8217;s goodness,&mdash;it contains too much
sense, sentiment, and good-spelling. It is impossible that even you
two, whom I declare to my God I will give credit for any degree of
excellence the sex are capable of attaining, it is impossible you can
go on to correspond at that rate; so like those who, Shenstone says,
retire because they make a good speech, I shall, after a few letters,
hear no more of you. I insist that you shall write whatever comes
first: what you see, what you read, what you hear, what you admire,
what you dislike, trifles, bagatelles, nonsense; or to fill up a
corner, e&#8217;en put down a laugh at full length. Now none of your polite
hints about flattery; I leave that to your lovers, if you have or
shall have any; though, thank heaven, I have found at last two girls
who can be luxuriantly happy in their own minds and with one another,
without that commonly necessary appendage to female bliss&mdash;<span class="f2">A LOVER.</span></p>

<p>Charlotte and you are just two favourite resting-places for my soul in
her wanderings through the weary, thorny wilderness of this world. God
knows I am ill-fitted for the struggle: I glory in being a Poet, and I

<h3>TO SIR JOHN WHITEFOORD.</h3>

<p>[The Whitefoords of Whitefoord, interested themselves in all matters

Burns, was not equal to their taste.]</p>

<p class="sig"><i>Edinburgh, December</i>, 1787.</p>

<p class="sig7"><span class="smcap">Sir,</span></p>

<p>Mr. Mackenzie, in Mauchline, my very warm and worthy friend, has
informed me how much you are pleased to interest yourself in my fate
as a man, and (what to me is incomparably dearer) my fame as a poet.
I have, Sir, in one or two instances, been patronized by those of your
character in life, when I was introduced to their notice by * * * * *
friends to them and honoured acquaintances to me! but you are the
first gentleman in the country whose benevolence and goodness of heart
has interested himself for me, unsolicited and unknown. I am not
master enough of the etiquette of these matters to know, nor did I
stay to inquire, whether formal duty bade, or cold propriety
disallowed, my thanking you in this manner, as I am convinced, from
the light in which you kindly view me, that you will do me the justice
to believe this letter is not the man&oelig;uvre of the needy, sharping
author, fastening on those in upper life, who honour him with a little
notice of him or his works. Indeed, the situation of poets is
generally such, to a proverb, as may, in some measure, palliate that
prostitution of heart and talents, they have at times been guilty of.
I do not think prodigality is, by any means, a necessary concomitant
of a poetic turn, but I believe a careless indolent attention to
economy, is almost inseparable from it; then there must be in the
heart of every bard of Nature&#8217;s making, a certain modest sensibility,
mixed with a kind of pride, that will ever keep him out of the way of
those windfalls of fortune which frequently light on hardy impudence
and foot-licking servility. It is not easy to imagine a more helpless
state than his whose poetic fancy unfits him for the world, and whose
character as a scholar gives him some pretensions to the <i>politesse</i>
of life&mdash;yet is as poor as I am.</p>

<p>For my part, I thank Heaven my star has been kinder; learning never
elevated my ideas above the peasant&#8217;s shed, and I have an independent
fortune at the plough-tail.</p>

<p>I was surprised to hear that any one who pretended in the least to the
manners of the gentleman, should be so foolish, or worse, as to stoop
to traduce the morals of such a one as I am, and so inhumanly cruel,
too, as to meddle with that late most unfortunate, unhappy part of my
story. With a tear of gratitude, I thank you, Sir, for the warmth with
which you interposed in behalf of my conduct. I am, I acknowledge, too
frequently the sport of whim, caprice, and passion, but reverence to
God, and integrity to my fellow-creatures, I hope I shall ever
preserve. I have no return, Sir, to make you for your goodness but
one&mdash;a return which, I am persuaded, will not be unacceptable&mdash;the

<h3>TO MISS WILLIAMS,</h3>

<h4>ON READING HER POEM OF THE SLAVE-TRADE.</h4>
<p>[The name and merits of Miss Williams are widely known; nor is it a
small honour to her muse that her tender song of &#8220;Evan Banks&#8221; was
imputed to Burns by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span> Cromek: other editors since have continued to
include it in his works, though Sir Walter Scott named the true
author.]</p>

<p class="sig"><i>Edinburgh, Dec.</i> 1787.</p>

<p>I know very little of scientific criticism, so all I can pretend to in
that intricate art is merely to note, as I read along, what passages
strike me as being uncommonly beautiful, and where the expression
seems to be perplexed or faulty.</p>

<p>The poem opens finely. There are none of these idle prefatory lines
which one may skip over before one comes to the subject. Verses 9th
and 10th in particular,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">&#8220;Where ocean&#8217;s unseen bound<br />
</span>
<span class="i0">Leaves a drear world of waters round,&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>are truly beautiful. The simile of the hurricane is likewise fine;
and, indeed, beautiful as the poem is, almost all the similes rise
decidedly above it. From verse 31st to verse 50th is a pretty eulogy
on Britain. Verse 36th, &#8220;That foul drama deep with wrong,&#8221; is nobly
expressive. Verse 46th, I am afraid, is rather unworthy of the rest;
&#8220;to dare to feel&#8221; is an idea that I do not altogether like. The
contrast of valour and mercy, from the 36th verse to the 50th, is
admirable.</p>

<p>Either my apprehension is dull, or there is something a little
confused in the apostrophe to Mr. Pitt. Verse 55th is the antecedent
to verses 57th and 58th, but in verse 58th the connexion seems
ungrammatical:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;Powers . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . <br /></span>
<span class="i0">. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . <br /></span>
<span class="i0">With no gradation mark&#8217;d their flight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But rose at once to glory&#8217;s height.&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Ris&#8217;n should be the word instead of rose. Try it in prose.
Powers,&mdash;their flight marked by no gradations, but [the same powers]
risen at once to the height of glory. Likewise, verse 53d, &#8220;For this,&#8221;
is evidently meant to lead on the sense of the verses 59th, 60th,
61st, and 62d: but let us try how the thread of connexion runs,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;For this . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .<br /></span>
<span class="i0">. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The deeds of mercy, that embrace<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A distant sphere, an alien race,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall virtue&#8217;s lips record and claim<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fairest honours of thy name.&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>I beg pardon if I misapprehended the matter, but this appears to me
the only imperfect passage in the poem. The comparison of the sunbeam
is fine.</p>

<p>The compliment to the Duke of Richmond is, I hope, as just as it is
certainly elegant The thought,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;Virtue . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .<br /></span>
<span class="i0">. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sends from her unsullied source,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The gems of thought their purest force,&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>is exceeding beautiful. The idea, from verse 81st to the 85th, that
the &#8220;blest decree&#8221; is like the beams of morning ushering in the
glorious day of liberty, ought not to pass unnoticed or unapplauded.
From verse 85th to verse 108th, is an animated contrast between the
unfeeling selfishness of the oppressor on the one hand, and the misery
of the captive on the other. Verse 88th might perhaps be amended thus:
&#8220;Nor ever <i>quit</i> her narrow maze.&#8221; We are said to <i>pass</i> a bound, but
we <i>quit</i>, a maze. Verse 100th is exquisitely beautiful:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;They, whom wasted blessings tire.&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Verse 110th is I doubt a clashing of metaphors: &#8220;to load a span&#8221; is, I
am afraid, an unwarrantable expression. In verse 114th, &#8220;Cast the
universe in shade,&#8221; is a fine idea. From the 115th verse to the 142d
is a striking description of the wrongs of the poor African. Verse
120th, &#8220;The load of unremitted pain,&#8221; is a remarkable, strong
expression. The address to the advocates for abolishing the
slave-trade, from verse 143d to verse 208th, is animated with the true
life of genius. The picture of oppression:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;While she links her impious chain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And calculates the price of pain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Weighs agony in sordid scales,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And marks if death or life prevails,&#8221;&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>is nobly executed.</p>

<p>What a tender idea is in verse 108th! Indeed, that whole description
of home may vie with Thomson&#8217;s description of home, somewhere in the
beginning of his Autumn. I do not remember to have seen a stronger
expression of misery than is contained in these verses:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;Condemned, severe extreme, to live<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When all is fled that life can give&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The comparison of our distant joys to distant objects is equally
original and striking.</p>

<p>The character and manners of the dealer in the infernal traffic is a
well done though a horrid picture. I am not sure how far introducing
the sailor was right; for though the sailor&#8217;s common characteristic is
generosity, yet, in this case, he is certainly not only an unconcerned
witness, but, in some degree, an efficient<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span> agent in the business.
Verse 224th is a nervous .... expressive&mdash;&#8220;The heart convulsive anguish
breaks.&#8221; The description of the captive wretch when he arrives in the
West Indies, is carried on with equal spirit. The thought that the
oppressor&#8217;s sorrow on seeing the slave pine, is like the butcher&#8217;s
regret when his destined lamb dies a natural death, is exceedingly
fine.</p>

<p>I am got so much into the cant of criticism, that I begin to be afraid
lest I have nothing except the cant of it; and instead of elucidating
my author, am only benighting myself. For this reason, I will not
pretend to go through the whole poem. Some few remaining beautiful
lines, however, I cannot pass over. Verse 280th is the strongest
description of selfishness I ever saw. The comparison of verses 285th
and 286th is new and fine; and the line, &#8220;Your arms to penury you
lend,&#8221; is excellent. In verse 317th, &#8220;like&#8221; should certainly be &#8220;as&#8221;
or &#8220;so;&#8221; for instance&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;His sway the hardened bosom leads<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To cruelty&#8217;s remorseless deeds:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As (or, so) the blue lightning when it springs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With fury on its livid wings,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Darts on the goal with rapid force,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor heeds that ruin marks its course.&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>If you insert the word &#8220;like&#8221; where I have placed &#8220;as,&#8221; you must alter
&#8220;darts&#8221; to &#8220;darting,&#8221; and &#8220;heeds&#8221; to &#8220;heeding&#8221; in order to make it
grammar. A tempest is a favourite subject with the poets, but I do not
remember anything even in Thomson&#8217;s Winter superior to your verses
from the 347th to the 351st. Indeed, the last simile, beginning with
&#8220;Fancy may dress,&#8221; &amp;c., and ending with the 350th verse, is, in my
opinion, the most beautiful passage in the poem; it would do honour to
the greatest names that ever graced our profession.</p>

<p>I will not beg your pardon, Madam, for these strictures, as my
conscience tells me, that for once in my life I have acted up to the
duties of a Christian, in doing as I would be done by.</p>

<h3>TO MR. RICHARD BROWN,</h3>

<h4>IRVINE.</h4>

<p>[Richard Brown was the &#8220;hapless son of misfortune,&#8221; alluded to by
Burns in his biographical letter to Dr. Moore: by fortitude and
prudence he retrieved his fortunes, and lived much respected in
Greenock, to a good old age. He said Burns had little to learn in
matters of levity, when he became acquainted with him.]</p>

<p class="sig"><i>Edinburgh, 30th Dec.</i> 1787.</p>

<p class="sig7"><span class="smcap">My dear Sir,</span></p>

<p>I have met with few things in life which have given me more pleasure
than Fortune&#8217;s kindness to you since those days in which we met in the
vale of misery; as I can honestly say, that I never knew a man who
more truly deserved it, or to whom my heart more truly wished it. I
have been much indebted since that time to your story and sentiments
for steeling my mind against evils, of which I have had a pretty
decent share. My will-o&#8217;wisp fate you know: do you recollect a Sunday
we spent together in Eglinton woods! You told me, on my repeating some
verses to you, that you wondered I could resist the temptation of
sending verses of such merit to a magazine. It was from this remark I
derived that idea of my own pieces, which encouraged me to endeavour
at the character of a poet. I am happy to hear that you will be two or
three months at home. As soon as a bruised limb will permit me, I
shall return to Ayrshire, and we shall meet; &#8220;and faith, I hope we&#8217;ll
not sit dumb, nor yet cast out!&#8221;</p>

<p>I have much to tell you &#8220;of men, their manners, and their ways,&#8221;
perhaps a little of the other sex. Apropos, I beg to be remembered to
Mrs. Brown. There I doubt not, my dear friend, but you have found
substantial happiness. I expect to find you something of an altered
but not a different man; the wild, bold, generous young fellow
composed into the steady affectionate husband, and the fond careful
parent. For me, I am just the same will-o&#8217;-wisp being I used to be.
About the first and fourth quarters of the moon, I generally set in
for the trade wind of wisdom: but about the full and change, I am the
luckless victim of mad tornadoes, which blow me into chaos. Almighty
love still reigns and revels in my bosom; and I am at this moment
ready to hang myself for a young Edinburgh widow, who has wit and
wisdom more murderously fatal than the assassinating stiletto of the
Sicilian banditti, or the poisoned arrow of the savage African. My
highland dirk, that used to hang beside my crutches, I have gravely
removed into a neighbouring closet, the key of which I cannot command
in case of spring-tide paroxysms. You may guess of her wit by

<h3>TO GAVIN HAMILTON.</h3>

<p>[The Hamiltons of the West continue to love the memory of Burns: the
old arm-chair in which the bard sat, when he visited Nanse Tinnocks,
was lately presented to the mason Lodge of Mauchline, by Dr. Hamilton,

<p class="sig">[<i>Edinburgh, Dec.</i> 1787.]</p>

<p class="sig7"><span class="smcap">My dear Sir,</span></p>

<p>It is indeed with the highest pleasure that I congratulate you on the
return of days of ease and nights of pleasure, after the horrid hours
of misery in which I saw you suffering existence when last in
Ayrshire; I seldom pray for any body, &#8220;I&#8217;m baith dead-sweer and
wretched ill o&#8217;t;&#8221; but most fervently do I beseech the Power that
directs the world, that you may live long and be happy, but live no
longer than you are happy. It is needless for me to advise you to have
a reverend care of your health. I know you will make it a point never
at one time to drink more than a pint of wine (I mean an English
pint), and that you will never be witness to more than one bowl of
punch at a time, and that cold drams you will never more taste; and,
above all things, I am convinced, that after drinking perhaps boiling
punch, you will never mount your horse and gallop home in a chill late
hour. Above all things, as I understand you are in habits of intimacy
with that Boanerges of gospel powers, Father Auld, be earnest with him
that he will wrestle in prayer for you, that you may see the vanity of
vanities in trusting to, or even practising the casual moral works of
charity, humanity, generosity, and forgiveness of things, which you
practised so flagrantly that it was evident you delighted in them,
neglecting, or perhaps profanely despising, the wholesome doctrine of
faith without works, the only anchor of salvation. A hymn of
thanksgiving would, in my opinion, be highly becoming from you at
present, and in my zeal for your well-being, I earnestly press on you
to be diligent in chanting over the two enclosed pieces of sacred
poesy. My best compliments to Mrs. Hamilton and Miss Kennedy.</p>

<p>[The blank which takes the place of the name of the &#8220;Gentleman in mind
and manners,&#8221; of this letter, cannot now be filled up, nor is it much
matter: the acquaintance of such a man as the poet describes few or
none would desire.]</p>

<p class="sig"><i>Edinburgh, Dec.</i> 1787.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Madam,</span></p>

<p>I just now have read yours. The poetic compliments I pay cannot be
misunderstood. They are neither of them so particular as to point you
out to the world at large; and the circle of your acquaintances will
allow all I have said. Besides, I have complimented you chiefly,
almost solely, on your mental charms. Shall I be plain with you? I
will; so look to it. Personal attractions, Madam, you have much above
par; wit, understanding, and worth, you possess in the first class.
This is a cursed flat way of telling you these truths, but let me hear
no more of your sheepish timidity. I know the world a little. I know
what they will say of my poems; by second sight I suppose; for I am
seldom out in my conjectures; and you may believe me, my dear Madam, I
would not run any risk of hurting you by any ill-judged compliment. I
wish to show to the world, the odds between a poet&#8217;s friends and those
of simple prosemen. More for your information, both the pieces go in.
One of them, &#8220;Where braving <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span> angry winter&#8217;s storms,&#8221; is already set&mdash;the tune is Neil Gow&#8217;s
Lamentation for <i>Abercarny</i>; the other is to be set to an old Highland
air in Daniel Dow&#8217;s collection of ancient Scots music; the name is
&#8220;<i>Ha a Chaillich air mo Dheith.</i>&#8221; My treacherous memory has forgot
every circumstance about <i>Les Incas</i>, only I think you mentioned them
as being in Creech&#8217;s possession. I shall ask him about it. I am afraid
the song of &#8220;Somebody&#8221; will come too late&mdash;as I shall, for certain,
leave town in a week for Ayrshire, and from that to Dumfries, but
there my hopes are slender. I leave my direction in town, so anything,
wherever I am, will reach me.</p>

<p>I saw yours to &mdash;&mdash;; it is not too severe, nor did he take it amiss. On
the contrary, like a whipt spaniel, he talks of being with you in the
Christmas days. Mr. &mdash;&mdash; has given him the invitation, and he is
determined to accept of it. O selfishness! he owns, in his sober
moments, that from his own volatility of inclination, the
circumstances in which he is situated, and his knowledge of his
father&#8217;s disposition;&mdash;the whole affair is chimerical&mdash;yet he <i>will</i>
gratify an idle <i>penchant</i> at the enormous, cruel expense, of perhaps
ruining the peace of the very woman for whom he professes the generous
passion of love! He is a gentleman in his mind and manners&mdash;<i>tant
pis</i>! He is a volatile school-boy&mdash;the heir of a man&#8217;s fortune who
well knows the value of two times two!</p>

<p>Perdition seize them and their fortunes, before they should make the
amiable, the lovely &mdash;&mdash;, the derided object of their purse-proud
contempt!</p>

<p>I am doubly happy to hear of Mrs. &mdash;&mdash;&#8217;srecovery, because I really
thought all was over with her. There are days of pleasure yet awaiting
her:</p>

not what they ought to be; yet better than what they appear to be.</p>

<p>After six weeks&#8217; confinement, I am beginning to walk across the room.
They have been six horrible weeks; anguish and low spirits made me
unfit to read, write, or think.</p>

<p>I have a hundred times wished that one could resign life as an officer
resigns a commission: for I would not take in any poor, ignorant
wretch, by selling out. Lately I was a sixpenny private; and, God
knows, a miserable soldier enough; now I march to the campaign, a
starving cadet: a little more conspicuously wretched.</p>

<p>I am ashamed of all this; for though I do want bravery for the warfare
of life, I could wish, like some other soldiers, to have as much
fortitude or cunning as to dissemble or conceal my cowardice.</p>

<p>As soon as I can bear the journey, which will be, I suppose, about the
middle of next week, I leave Edinburgh: and soon after I shall pay my
grateful duty at Dunlop-House.</p>

<p class="sig7"><span class="smcap">Reverend and dear Sir</span>,</p>

<p>I have been a cripple now near three months, though I am getting
vastly better, and have been very much hurried beside, or else I would
have wrote you sooner. I must beg your pardon for the epistle you sent
me appearing in the Magazine. I had given a copy or two to some of my
intimate friends, but did not know of the printing of it till the
publication of the Magazine. However, as it does great honour to us
both, you will forgive it.</p>

<p>The second volume of the songs I mentioned to you in my last is
published to-day. I send you a copy which I beg you will accept as a
mark of the veneration I have long had, and shall ever have, for your
character, and of the claim I make to your continued acquaintance.
Your songs appear in the third volume, with your name in the index;
as, I assure you, Sir, I have heard your &#8220;Tullochgorum,&#8221; particularly
among our west-country folks, given to many different names, and most
commonly to the immortal author of &#8220;The Minstrel,&#8221; who, indeed, never
wrote anything superior to &#8220;Gie&#8217;s a sang, Montgomery cried.&#8221; Your
brother has promised me your verses to the Marquis of Huntley&#8217;s reel,
which certainly deserve a place in the collection. My kind host, Mr.
Cruikshank, of the High-school here, and said to be one of the best
Latins in this age, begs me to make you his grateful acknowledgments
for the entertainment he has got in a Latin publication of yours, that
I borrowed for him from your acquaintance and much respected friend in
this place, the Reverend Dr. Webster. Mr. Cruikshank maintains that
you write the best Latin since Buchanan. I leave Edinburgh to-morrow,
but shall return in three weeks. Your song you mentioned in your last,
to the tune of &#8220;Dumbarton Drums,&#8221; and the other, which you say was
done by a brother by trade of mine, a ploughman, I shall thank you
much for a copy of each. I am ever, Reverend Sir, with the most
respectful esteem and sincere veneration, yours,</p>

<p>I received yours with the greatest pleasure. I shall arrive at Glasgow
on Monday evening; and beg, if possible, you will meet me on Tuesday.
I shall wait you Tuesday all day. I shall be found at Davies&#8217;, Black
Bull inn. I am hurried, as if hunted by fifty devils, else I should go
to Greenock: but if you cannot possibly come, write me, if possible,
to Glasgow, on Monday; or direct to me at Mossgiel by Mauchline; and
name a day and place in Ayrshire, within a fortnight from this date,
where I may meet you. I only stay a fortnight in Ayrshire, and return
to Edinburgh. I am ever, my dearest friend, yours,</p>

<h3>TO MRS. ROSE, OF KILRAVOCK.</h3>

<p>[Mrs. Rose of Kilravock, a lady distinguished by the elegance of her
manners, as well as by her talents, was long remembered by Burns: she
procured for him snatches of old songs, and copies of northern
melodies; to her we owe the preservation of some fine airs as well as
the inspiration of some fine lyrics.]</p>

<p class="sig"><i>Edinburgh, February 17th, 1788.</i></p>

<p class="sig7"><span class="smcap">Madam</span>,</p>

<p>You are much indebted to some indispensable business I have had on my
hands, otherwise my gratitude threatened such a return for your
obliging favour as would have tired your patience. It but poorly
expresses my feelings to say, that I am sensible of your kindness: it
may be said of hearts such as yours is, and such, I hope, mine is,
much more justly than Addison applies it,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;Some souls by instinct to each other turn.&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>There was something in my reception at Kilravock so different from the
cold, obsequious, dancing-school bow of politeness, that it almost got
into my head that friendship had occupied<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span> her ground without the
intermediate march of acquaintance. I wish I could transcribe, or
rather transfuse into language, the glow of my heart when I read your
letter. My ready fancy, with colours more mellow than life itself,
painted the beautifully wild scenery of Kilravock&mdash;the venerable
grandeur of the castle&mdash;the spreading woods&mdash;the winding river, gladly
leaving his unsightly, heathy source, and lingering with apparent
delight as he passes the fairy walk at the bottom of the garden;&mdash;your
late distressful anxieties&mdash;your present enjoyments&mdash;your dear little
angel, the pride of your hopes;&mdash;my aged friend, venerable in worth
and years, whose loyalty and other virtues will strongly entitle her
to the support of the Almighty Spirit here, and his peculiar favour in
a happier state of existence. You cannot imagine, Madam, how much such
feelings delight me; they are my dearest proofs of my own immortality.
Should I never revisit the north, as probably I never will, nor again
see your hospitable mansion, were I, some twenty years hence, to see
your little fellow&#8217;s name making a proper figure in a newspaper
paragraph, my heart would bound with pleasure.</p>

<p>I am assisting a friend in a collection of Scottish songs, set to
their proper tunes; every air worth preserving is to be included:
among others I have given &#8220;Morag,&#8221; and some few Highland airs which
pleased me most, a dress which will be more generally known, though
far, far inferior in real merit. As a small mark of my grateful
esteem, I beg leave to present you with a copy of the work, as far as
it is printed; the Man of Feeling, that first of men, has promised to
transmit it by the first opportunity.</p>

<p>I beg to be remembered most respectfully to my venerable friend, and
to your little Highland chieftain. When you see the &#8220;two fair spirits
of the hill,&#8221; at Kildrummie,<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> tell them that I have done myself the
honour of setting myself down as one of their admirers for at least
twenty years to come, consequently they must look upon me as an
acquaintance for the same period; but, as the apostle Paul says, &#8220;this
I ask of grace, not of debt.&#8221;</p>

mine, the devil, the world, and the flesh&mdash;so terrible in the fields
of dissipation. I have met with few incidents in my life which gave me
so much pleasure as meeting you in Glasgow. There is a time of life
beyond which we cannot form a tie worth the name of friendship. &#8220;O
youth! enchanting stage, profusely blest.&#8221; Life is a fairy scene:
almost all that deserves the name of enjoyment or pleasure is only a
charming delusion; and in comes repining age in all the gravity of
hoary wisdom, and wretchedly chases away the bewitching phantom. When
I think of life, I resolve to keep a strict look-out in the course of
economy, for the sake of worldly convenience and independence of mind;
to cultivate intimacy with a few of the companions of youth, that they
may be the friends of age; never to refuse my liquorish humour a
handful of the sweetmeats of life, when they come not too dear; and,
for futurity,&mdash;</p>

<h3>TO MR. WILLIAM CRUIKSHANK.</h3>

<p>[The excise and farming alternately occupied the poet&#8217;s thoughts in
Edinburgh: he studied books of husbandry <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>and took lessons in gauging,
and in the latter he became expert.]</p>

<p class="sig"><i>Mauchline, March 3d, 1788.</i></p>

<p class="sig7"><span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,</p>

<p>Apologies for not writing are frequently like apologies for not
singing&mdash;the apology better than the song. I have fought my way
severely through the savage hospitality of this country, to send every
guest drunk to bed if they can.</p>

<p>I executed your commission in Glasgow, and I hope the cocoa came safe.
&#8217;Twas the same price and the very same kind as your former parcel, for
the gentleman recollected your buying there perfectly well.</p>

<p>I should return my thanks for your &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hospitality (I
leave a blank for the epithet, as I know none can do it justice) to a
poor, wayfaring bard, who was spent and utmost overpowered fighting
with prosaic wickednesses in high places; but I am afraid lest you
should burn the letter whenever you come to the passage, so I pass
over it in silence. I am just returned from visiting Mr. Miller&#8217;s
farm. The friend whom I told you I would take with me was highly
pleased with the farm; and as he is, without exception, the most
intelligent farmer in the country, he has staggered me a good deal. I
have the two plans of life before me; I shall balance them to the best
of my judgment, and fix on the most eligible. I have written Mr.
Miller, and shall wait on him when I come to town, which shall be the
beginning or middle of next week; I would be in sooner, but my unlucky
knee is rather worse, and I fear for some time will scarcely stand the
fatigue of my Excise instructions. I only mention these ideas to you;
and, indeed, except Mr. Ainslie, whom I intend writing to to-morrow, I
will not write at all to Edinburgh till I return to it. I would send
my compliments to Mr. Nicol, but he would be hurt if he knew I wrote
to anybody and not to him: so I shall only beg my best, kindest,
kindest compliments to my worthy hostess and the sweet little
rose-bud.</p>

<p>So soon as I am settled in the routine of life, either as an
Excise-officer, or as a farmer, I propose myself great pleasure from a
regular correspondence with the only man almost I ever saw who joined
the most attentive prudence with the warmest generosity.</p>

<p>I am much interested for that best of men, Mr. Wood; I hope he is in
better health and spirits than when I saw him last.</p>

<p class="sig7"><span class="smcap">My dear Friend</span>,</p>

<p>I am just returned from Mr. Miller&#8217;s farm. My old friend whom I took
with me was highly pleased with the bargain, and advised me to accept
of it. He is the most intelligent sensible farmer in the county, and
his advice has staggered me a good deal. I have the two plans before
me: I shall endeavour to balance them to the best of my judgement, and
fix on the most eligible. On the whole, if I find Mr. Miller in the
same favourable disposition as when I saw him last, I shall in all
probability turn farmer.</p>

<p>I have been through sore tribulation and under much buffeting of the
wicked one since I came to this country. Jean I found banished,
forlorn, destitute and friendless: I have reconciled her to her fate,
and I have reconciled her to her mother.</p>

<p>I shall be in Edinburgh middle of next week. My farming ideas I shall
keep private till I see. I got a letter from Clarinda yesterday, and
she tells me she has got no letter of mine but one. Tell her that I
wrote to her from Glasgow, from Kilmarnock, from Mauchline, and
yesterday from Cumnock as I returned from Dumfries. Indeed she is the
only person in Edinburgh I have written to till this day. How are your
soul and body putting up?&mdash;a little like man and wife, I suppose.</p>

<p>I have been out of the country, my dear friend, and have not had an
opportunity of writing till now, when I am afraid you will be gone out
of the country too. I have been looking at farms, and, after all,
perhaps I may settle in the character of a farmer. I have got so
vicious a bent to idleness, and have ever been so little a man of
business, that it will take no ordinary effort to bring my mind
properly into the routine: but you will save a &#8220;great effort is worthy
of you.&#8221; I say so myself; and butter up my vanity with all the
stimulating compliments I can think of. Men of grave, geometrical
minds, the sons of &#8220;which was to be demonstrated,&#8221; may cry up reason
as much as they please; but I have always found an honest passion, or
native instinct, the truest auxiliary in the warfare of this world.
Reason almost always comes to me like an unlucky wife to a poor devil
of a husband, just in sufficient time to add her reproaches to his
other grievances.</p>

<h3>TO MR. MUIR.</h3>

<p>[The change which Burns says in this letter took place in his ideas,

one of his letters to Smith, he meditated for some time after his
debut in Edinburgh.]</p>

<p class="sig"><i>Mossgiel, 7th March</i>, 1788.</p>

<p class="sig7"><span class="smcap">Dear Sir,</span></p>

<p>I have partly changed my ideas, my dear friend, since I saw you. I
took old Glenconner with mo to Mr. Miller&#8217;s farm, and he was so
pleased with it, that I have wrote an offer to Mr. Miller, which, if
he accepts, I shall sit down a plain farmer, the happiest of lives
when a man can live by it. In this case I shall not stay in Edinburgh
above a week. I set out on Monday, and would have come by Kilmarnock,
but there are several small sums owing me for my first edition about
Galston and Newmills, and I shall set off so early as to dispatch my
business, and reach Glasgow by night. When I return, I shall devote a
forenoon or two to make some kind of acknowledgment for all the
kindness I owe your friendship. Now that I hope to settle with some
credit and comfort at home, there was not any friendship or friendly
correspondence that promised me more pleasure than yours; I hope I
will not be disappointed. I trust the spring will renew your shattered
frame, and make your friends happy. You and I have often agreed that
life is no great blessing on the whole. The close of life, indeed, to
a reasoning eye, is,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;Dark as was chaos, ere the infant sun<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was roll&#8217;d together, or had try&#8217;d his beams<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>But an honest man has nothing to fear. If we lie down in the grave,
the whole man a piece of broken machinery, to moulder with the clods
of the valley, be it so: at least there is an end of pain, care, woes,
and wants: if that part of us called mind does survive the apparent
destruction of the man&mdash;away with old-wife prejudices and tales! Every
age and every nation has had a different set of stories; and as the
many are always weak, of consequence, they have often, perhaps always,
been deceived; a man conscious of having acted an honest part among
his fellow-creatures&mdash;even granting that he may have been the sport at
times of passions and instincts&mdash;he goes to a great unknown Being, who
could have no other end in giving him existence but to make him happy,
who gave him those passions and instincts, and well knows their force.</p>

<p>These, my worthy friend, are my ideas; and I know they are not far
different from yours. It becomes a man of sense to think for himself,
particularly in a case where all men are equally interested, and
where, indeed, all men are equally in the dark.</p>

<p>The last paragraph in yours of the 30th February affected me most, so
I shall begin my answer where you ended your letter. That I am often a
sinner with any little wit I have, I do confess: but I have taxed my
recollection to no purpose, to find out when it was employed against
you. I hate an ungenerous sarcasm a great deal worse than I do the
devil; at least as Milton described him; and though I may be rascally
enough to be sometimes guilty of it myself, I cannot endure it in
others. You, my honoured friend, who cannot appear in any light but
you are sure of being respectable&mdash;you can afford to pass by an
occasion to display your wit, because you may depend for fame on your
sense; or, if you choose to be silent, you know you can rely on the
gratitude of many, and the esteem of all; but, God help us, who are
wits or witlings by profession, if we stand for fame there, we sink
unsupported!</p>

<p>I am highly flattered by the news you tell me of Coila. I may say to
the fair painter who does me so much honour, as Dr. Beattie says to
Ross the poet of his muse Scota, from which, by the bye, I took the

suit.]</p>

<p class="sig"><i>Edinburgh, March 14, 1788.</i></p>

<p>I know, my ever dear friend, that you will be pleased with the news
when I tell you, I have at last taken a lease of a farm. Yesternight I
completed a bargain with Mr. Miller, of Dalswinton for the farm of
Ellisland, on the banks of the Nith, between five and six miles above
Dumfries. I begin at Whit-Sunday to build a house, drive lime, &amp;c.;
and heaven be my help! for it will take a strong effort to bring my
mind into the routine of business. I have discharged all the army of
my former pursuits, fancies, and pleasures; a motley host! and have
literally and strictly retained only the ideas of a few friends, which
I have incorporated into a lifeguard. I trust in Dr. Johnson&#8217;s
observation, &#8220;Where much is attempted, something is done.&#8221; Firmness,
both in sufferance and exertion, is a character I would wish to be
thought to possess: and have always despised the whining yelp of
complaint, and the cowardly, feeble resolve.</p>

<p>Poor Miss K. is ailing a good deal this winter, and begged me to
remember her to you the first time I wrote to you. Surely woman,
amiable woman, is often made in vain. Too delicately formed for the
rougher pursuits of ambition; too noble for the dirt of avarice, and
even too gentle for the rage of pleasure; formed indeed for, and
highly susceptible of enjoyment and rapture; but that enjoyment, alas!
almost wholly at the mercy of the caprice, malevolence, stupidity, or
wickedness of an animal at all times comparatively unfeeling, and
often brutal.</p>

tried these words to it. You will see that the first part of the tune
must be repeated.</p>

<p>I am tolerably pleased with these verses, but as I have only a sketch
of the tune, I leave it with you to try if they suit the measure of
the music.</p>

<p>I am so harassed with care and anxiety, about this farming project of
mine, that my muse has degenerated into the veriest prose-wench that
ever picked cinders, or followed a tinker. When I am fairly got into

perhaps with some queries respecting farming; at present, the world

<h3>TO MR. WILLIAM DUNBAR,</h3>

<h4>EDINBURGH.</h4>
<p>[This letter was printed for the first time by Robert Chambers, in his
&#8220;People&#8217;s Edition&#8221; of Burns.]</p>

<p class="sig"><i>Mauchline, 7th April, 1788.</i></p>

<p>I have not delayed so long to write you, my much respected friend,
because I thought no farther of my promise. I have long since give up
that kind of formal correspondence, where one sits down irksomely to
write a letter, because we think we are in duty bound so to do.</p>

<p>I have been roving over the country, as the farm I have taken is forty
miles from this place, hiring servants and preparing matters; but most
of all I am earnestly busy to bring about a revolution in my own mind.
As, till within these eighteen months, I never was the wealthy master
of 10 guineas, my knowledge of business is to learn; add to this my
late scenes of idleness and dissipation have enervated my mind to an
alarming degree. Skill in the sober science of life is my most serious
and hourly study. I have dropt all conversation and all reading (prose
reading) but what tends in some way or other to my serious aim. Except
one worthy young fellow, I have not one single correspondent in
Edinburgh. You have indeed kindly made me an offer of that kind. The
world of wits, and <i>gens comme il faut</i> which I lately left, and with
whom I never again will intimately mix&mdash;from that port, Sir, I expect
your Gazette: what <i>Les beaux esprit</i> are saying, what they are doing,
and what they are singing. Any sober intelligence from my sequestered
walks of life; any droll original; any passing reward, important
forsooth, because it is mine; any little poetic effort, however
embryoth; these, my dear Sir, are all you have to expect from me. When
I talk of poetic efforts, I must have it always understood, that I
appeal from your wit and taste to your friendship and good nature. The
first would be my favourite tribunal, where I defied censure; but the
last, where I declined justice.</p>

<p>I have scarcely made a single distich since I saw you. When I meet
with an old Scots air that has any facetious idea in its name, I have
a peculiar pleasure in following out that idea for a verse or two.</p>

<p>I trust that this will find you in better health<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span> than I did last time
I called for you. A few lines from you, directed to me at Mauchline,
were it but to let me know how you are, will set my mind a good deal
[at rest.] Now, never shun the idea of writing me because perhaps you
may be out of humour or spirits. I could give you a hundred good
consequences attending a dull letter; one, for example, and the
remaining ninety-nine some other time&mdash;it will always serve to keep in
countenance, my much respected Sir, your obliged friend and humble
servant,</p>

<p>I am indebted to you and Miss Nimmo for letting me know Miss Kennedy.
Strange! how apt we are to indulge prejudices in our judgments of one
another! Even I, who pique myself on my skill in marking
characters&mdash;because I am too proud of my character as a man, to be
dazzled in my judgment for glaring wealth; and too proud of my
situation as a poor man to be biased against squalid poverty&mdash;I was
unacquainted with Miss K.&#8217;s very uncommon worth.</p>

<p>I am going on a good deal progressive in <i>mon grand b&ucirc;t</i>, the sober

circumstances, you should applaud me.</p>

<p class="sig"><i>No date.</i></p>

<p>Now for that wayward, unfortunate thing, myself. I have broke measures
with Creech, and last week I wrote him a frosty, keen letter. He
replied in terms of chastisement, and promised me upon his honour that
I should have the account on Monday; but this is Tuesday, and yet I
have not heard a word from him. God have mercy on me! a poor d&mdash;mned,
incautious, duped, unfortunate fool! The sport, the miserable victim
of rebellious pride, hypochondriac imagination, agonizing sensibility,
and bedlam passions?</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish that I were dead, but I&#8217;m no like to die!&#8221; I had lately &#8220;a
hair-breadth &#8216;scape in th&#8217; imminent deadly breach&#8221; of love too. Thank
my stars, I got off heart-whole, &#8220;waur fleyd than
hurt.&#8221;&mdash;Interruption.</p>

<p>I have this moment got a hint: I fear I am something like&mdash;undone&mdash;but
I hope for the best. Come, stubborn pride and unshrinking resolution;
accompany me through this, to me, miserable world! You must not desert
me! Your friendship I think I can count on, though I should date my
letters from a marching regiment. Early in life, and all my life I
reckoned on a recruiting drum as my forlorn hope. Seriously though,
life at present presents me with but a melancholy path: but&mdash;my limb
will soon be sound, and I shall struggle on.</p>

<p class="sig"><i>Edinburgh, Sunday.</i></p>

<p>To-morrow, my dear madam, I leave Edinburgh. I have altered all my
plans of future life. A farm that I could live in, I could not find;
and, indeed, after the necessary support my brother and the rest of
the family required, I could not venture on farming in that style
suitable to my feelings. You will condemn me for the next step I have
taken. I have entered into the Excise. I stay in the west about three
weeks, and then return to Edinburgh, for six weeks&#8217; instructions:
afterwards, for I get employ instantly, I go <i>o&ugrave; il plait &agrave;
Dieu</i>,&mdash;<i>et mon Roi.</i> I have chosen this, my dear friend, after mature
deliberation. The question is not at what door of fortune&#8217;s palace
shall we enter in; but what doors does she open to us? I was not
likely to get anything to do. I wanted <i>un b&ucirc;t</i>, which is a dangerous,
an unhappy situation. I got this without any hanging on, or mortifying
solicitation; it is immediate bread, and though poor in comparison of
the last eighteen months of my existence, &#8217;tis luxury in com<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>parison

<h3>TO MRS. DUNLOP.</h3>

<p>[The Tasso, with the perusal of which Mrs. Dunlop indulged the poet,
was not the line version of Fairfax, but the translation of Hoole&mdash;a
far inferior performance.]</p>

<p class="sig"><i>Mauchline, 28th April, 1788.</i></p>

<p class="sig7"><span class="smcap">Madam</span>,</p>

<p>Your powers of reprehension must be great indeed, as I assure you they
made my heart ache with penitential pangs, even though I was really
not guilty. As I commence farmer at Whit-Sunday, you will easily guess
I must be pretty busy; but that is not all. As I got the offer of the
Excise business without solicitation, and as it costs me only six
months&#8217; attendance for instructions, to entitle me to a
commission&mdash;which commission lies by me, and at any future period, on
my simple petition, ca be resumed&mdash;I thought five-and-thirty pounds
a-year was no bad <i>dernier ressort</i> for a poor poet, if fortune in her
jade tricks should kick him down from the little eminence to which she
has lately helped him up.</p>

<p>For this reason, I am at present attending these instructions, to have
them completed before Whit-sunday. Still, Madam, I prepared with the
sincerest pleasure to meet you at the Mount, and came to my brother&#8217;s
on Saturday night, to set out on Sunday; but for some nights preceding
I had slept in an apartment, where the force of the winds and rains
was only mitigated by being sifted through numberless apertures in the
windows, walls, &amp;c. In consequence I was on Sunday, Monday, and part
of Tuesday, unable to stir out of bed, with all the miserable effects
of a violent cold.</p>

<p>You see, Madam, the truth of the French maxim, <i>le vrai n&#8217;est pas
toujours le vraisemblable</i>; your last was so full of expostulation,
and was something so like the language of an offended friend, that I
began to tremble for a correspondence, which I had with grateful
pleasure set down as one of the greatest enjoyments of my future life.</p>

<p>Your books have delighted me: Virgil, Dryden, and Tasso were all
equally strangers to me; but of this more at large in my next.</p>

<p>There is no understanding a man properly, without knowing something of
his previous ideas (that is to say, if the man has any ideas; for I
know many who, in the animal-muster, pass for men, that are the scanty
masters of only one idea on any given subject, and by far the greatest
part of your acquaintances and mine can barely boast of ideas,
1.25&mdash;1.5&mdash;1.75 or some such fractional matter;) so to let you a
little into the secrets of my pericranium, there is, you must know, a

title to my corpus.</p>

<p>says the wise old Scots adage! I hate to presage ill-luck; and as my
girl has been doubly kinder to me than even the best of women usually
are to their partners of our sex, in similar circumstances, I reckon
on twelve times a brace of children against I celebrate my twelfth
wedding-day: these twenty-four will give me twenty-four gossipings,
twenty-four christenings (I mean one equal to two), and I hope, by the
blessing of the God of my fathers, to make them twenty-four dutiful
children to their parents, twenty-four useful members of society, and
twenty-four approved services of their God! * * *</p>

<p>&#8220;Light&#8217;s heartsome,&#8221; quo&#8217; the wife when she was stealing sheep. You
see what a lamp I have hung up to lighten your paths, when you are
idle enough to explore the combinations and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span> relations of my ideas.
&#8217;Tis now as plain as a pike-staff, why a twenty-four gun battery was a
metaphor I could readily employ.</p>

<p>Now for business.&mdash;I intend to present Mrs. Burns with a printed
shawl, an article of which I dare say you have variety: &#8217;tis my first
present to her since I have irrevocably called her mine, and I have a
kind of whimsical wish to get her the first said present from an old
and much-valued friend of hers and mine, a trusty Trojan, on whose
friendship I count myself possessed of as a life-rent lease.</p>

<p>Look on this letter as a &#8220;beginning of sorrows;&#8221; I will write you till

<p>[A poem, something after the fashion of the Georgics, was long present

<p class="sig7"><span class="smcap">Madam</span>,</p>

<p>Dryden&#8217;s Virgil has delighted me. I do not know whether the critics
will agree with me, but the Georgics are to me by far the best of
Virgil. It is indeed a species of writing entirely new to me; and has
filled my head with a thousand fancies of emulation: but, alas! when I
read the Georgics, and then survey my own powers, &#8217;tis like the idea
of a Shetland pony, drawn up by the side of a thorough-bred hunter to
start for the plate. I own I am disappointed in the &AElig;neid. Faultless
correctness may please, and does highly please, the lettered critic:
but to that awful character I have not the most distant pretensions. I
do not know whether I do not hazard my pretensions to be a critic of
any kind, when I say that I think Virgil, in many instances, a servile
copier of Homer. If I had the Odyssey by me, I could parallel many
passages where Virgil has evidently copied, but by no means improved,
Homer. Nor can I think there is anything of this owing to the
translators; for, from everything I have seen of Dryden, I think him
in genius and fluency of language, Pope&#8217;s master. I have not perused
Tasso enough to form an opinion: in some future letter, you shall have
my ideas of him; though I am conscious my criticisms must be very
inaccurate and imperfect, as there I have ever felt and lamented my
want of learning most.</p>

<h3>TO MRS. DUNLOP.</h3>

<p>[This letter, on the hiring season, is well worth the consideration of
all masters, and all servants. In England, servants are engaged by the
month; in Scotland by the half-year, and therefore less at the mercy
of the changeable and capricious.]</p>

<p>I have been torturing my philosophy to no purpose, to account for that
kind partiality of yours, which has followed me, in my return to the
shade of life, with assiduous benevolence. Often did I regret, in the
fleeting hours of my late will-o&#8217;-wisp appearance, that &#8220;here I had no
continuing city;&#8221; and but for the consolation of a few solid guineas,
could almost lament the time that a momentary acquaintance with wealth
and splendour put me so much out of conceit with the sworn companions
of my road through life&mdash;insignificance and poverty.</p>

<p>There are few circumstances relating to the unequal distribution of
the good things of this life that give me more vexation (I mean in
what I see around me) than the importance the opulent bestow on their
trifling family affairs, compared with the very same things on the
contracted scale of a cottage. Last afternoon I had the honour to
spend an hour or two at a good woman&#8217;s fireside, where the planks that
composed the floor were decorated with a splendid carpet, and the gay
table sparkled with silver and china. &#8217;Tis now about term-day, and
there has been a revolution among those creatures, who though in
appearance partakers, and equally noble partakers, of the same nature
with Madame, are from time to time&mdash;their nerves, their sinews, their
health, strength, wisdom, experience, genius, time, nay a good part of
their very thoughts&mdash;sold for months and years, not only to the
necessities, the conveniences, but, the caprices of the important few.
We talked of the insignificant creatures, nay notwithstanding their
general stupidity and rascality, did some of the poor devils the
honour to commend them. But light be the turf upon his breast who
taught &#8220;Reverence thyself!&#8221; We looked down on the unpolished wretches,
their impertinent wives and clouterly brats, as the lordly bull does
on the little dirty ant-hill, whose puny inhabitants he crushes in the
carelessness of his ramble, or tosses in the air in the wantonness of
his pride.</p>

yesterday, except Jenny Geddes, the old mare I ride on; while uncouth
cares and novel plans hourly insult my awkward ignorance and bashful
inexperience. There is a foggy atmosphere native to my soul in the
hour of care; consequently the dreary objects seem larger than life.
Extreme sensibility, irritated and prejudiced on the gloomy side by a
series of misfortunes and disappointments, at that period of my
existence when the soul is laying in her cargo of ideas for the voyage
of life, is, I believe, the principal cause of this unhappy frame of

<p>Your surmise, Madam, is just; I am indeed a husband.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>To jealousy or infidelity I am an equal stranger. My preservative from
the first is the most thorough consciousness of her sentiments of
honour, and her attachment to me: my antidote against the last is my
long and deep-rooted affection for her.</p>

<p>In housewife matters, of aptness to learn and activity to execute, she
is eminently mistress; and during my absence in Nithsdale, she is
regularly and constantly apprentice to my mother and sisters in their
dairy and other rural business.</p>

<p>The muses must not be offended when I tell them, the concerns of my
wife and family will, in my mind, always take the <i>pas</i>; but I assure
them their ladyships will ever come next in place.</p>

<p>You are right that a bachelor state would have insured me more
friends; but from a cause you will easily guess, conscious peace in
the enjoyment of my own mind, and unmistrusting confidence in
approaching my God, would seldom have been of the number.</p>

<p>I found a once much-loved and still much-loved female, literally and
truly cast out to the mercy of the naked elements; but I enabled her
to <i>purchase</i> a shelter;&mdash;there is no sporting with a
fellow-creature&#8217;s happiness or misery.</p>

<p>The most placid good-nature and sweetness of disposition; a warm
heart, gratefully devoted with all its powers to love me; vigorous
health and sprightly cheerfulness, set off to the best advantage by a
more than commonly handsome figure; these, I think, in a woman, may
make a good wife, though she should never have read a page but the
Scriptures of the Old and New Testament, nor have danced in a brighter
assembly than a penny pay-wedding.</p>

<p>[Had Burns written his fine song, beginning &#8220;Contented wi&#8217; little and
cantie wi&#8217; mair,&#8221; when he penned this letter, the prose might have
followed as a note to the verse; he calls the Excise a luxury.]</p>

<p class="sig"><i>Ellisland, June 14th, 1788.</i></p>

<p>This is now the third day, my dearest Sir, that I have sojourned in
these regions; and during these three days you have occupied more of
my thoughts than in three weeks preceding: in Ayrshire I have several
variations of friendship&#8217;s compass, here it points invariably to the
pole. My farm gives me a good many uncouth cares and anxieties, but I
hate the language of complaint. Job, or some one of his friends, says
well&mdash;&#8220;why should a living man complain?&#8221;</p>

<p>I have lately been much mortified with contemplating an unlucky
imperfection in the very framing and construction of my soul; namely,
a blundering inaccuracy of her olfactory organs in hitting the scent
of craft or design in my fellow-creatures. I do not mean any
compliment to my ingenuousness, or to hint that the defect is in
consequence of the unsuspicious simplicity of conscious truth or
honour: I take it to be, in some, why or other, an imperfection in the
mental sight; or, metaphor apart, some modification of dulness. In two
or three small instances lately, I have been most shamefully out.</p>

<p>I have all along hitherto, in the warfare of life, been bred to arms
among the light-horse&mdash;the piquet-guards of fancy: a kind of hussars
and Highlanders of the brain; but I am firmly resolved to sell out of
these giddy battalions, who have no ideas of a battle but fighting the
foe, or of a siege but storming the town. Cost what it will, I am
determined to buy in among the grave squadrons of heavy-armed thought,
or the artillery corps of plodding contrivance.</p>

<p>What books are you reading, or what is the subject of your thoughts,
besides the great studies of your profession? You said something about
religion in your last. I don&#8217;t exactly remember what it was, as the
letter is in Ayrshire; but I thought it not only prettily said, but
nobly thought. You will make a noble fellow if once you were married.
I make no reservation of your being well-married: you have so much
sense, and knowledge of human nature, that though you may not realize
perhaps the ideas of romance, yet you will never be ill-married.</p>

<p>This letter, my dear Sir, is only a business scrap. Mr. Miers, profile
painter in your town, has executed a profile of Dr. Blacklock for me:
do me the favour to call for it, and sit to him yourself for me, which
put in the same size as the doctor&#8217;s. The account of both profiles
will be fifteen shillings, which I have given to James Connell, our
Mauchline carrier, to pay you when you give him the parcel. You must
not, my friend, refuse to sit. The time is short: when I sat to Mr.
Miers, I am sure he did not exceed two minutes. I propose hanging Lord
Glencairn, the Doctor, and you in trio over my new chimney-piece that
is to be.</p>

<h3>TO ROBERT AINSLIE, ESQ.</h3>

<p>[&#8220;There is a degree of folly,&#8221; says Burns in this letter, &#8220;in talking
unnecessarily of one&#8217;s private affairs.&#8221; The folly is scarcely less to
write about them, and much did the poet and his friend write about
their own private affairs as well as those of others.]</p>

<p class="sig"><i>Ellisland, June 30th, 1788.</i></p>

<p class="sig7"><span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,</p>

<p>I just now received your brief epistle; and, to take vengeance on your
laziness, I have, you see, taken a long sheet of writing-paper, and
have begun at the top of the page, intending to scribble on to the
very last corner.</p>

<p>I am vexed at that affair of the * * *, but dare not enlarge on the
subject until you send me your direction, as I suppose that will be
altered on your late master and friend&#8217;s death. I am concerned for the
old fellow&#8217;s exit, only as I fear it may be to your disadvantage in
any respect&mdash;for an old man&#8217;s dying, except he has been a very
benevolent character, or in some particular situation of life that the
welfare of the poor or the helpless depended on him, I think it an
event of the most trifling moment in the world. Man is naturally a
kind, benevolent animal, but he is dropped into such a needy situation
here in this vexatious world, and has such a whoreson hungry,
growling, multiplying pack of necessities, appetites, passions, and
desires about him, ready to devour him for want of other food; that in
fact he must lay aside his cares for others that he may look properly
to himself. You have been imposed upon in paying Mr. Miers for the
profile of a Mr. H. I did not mention it in my letter to you, nor did
I ever give Mr. Miers any such order. I have no objection to lose the
money, but I will not have any such profile in my possession.</p>

<p>I desired the carrier to pay you, but as I mentioned only fifteen
shillings to him, I would rather enclose you a guinea note. I have it
not, indeed, to spare here, as I am only a sojourner in a strange land
in this place; but in a day or two I return to Mauchline, and there I
have the bank-notes through the house like salt permits.</p>

<p>There is a great degree of folly in talking unnecessarily of one&#8217;s
private affairs. I have just now been interrupted by one of my new
neighbours, who has made himself absolutely contemptible in my eyes,
by his silly garrulous pruriency. I know it has been a fault of my
own, too; but from this moment I abjure it, as I would the service of
hell! Your poets, spend-thrifts, and other fools of that kidney,
pretend forsooth to crack their jokes on prudence; but &#8217;tis a squalid
vagabond glorying in his rags. Still, imprudence respecting money
matters is much more pardonable than imprudence respecting character.
I have no objection to prefer prodigality to avarice, in some few
instances; but I appeal to your observation, if you have not met, and
often met, with the same disingenuousness, the same hollow-hearted
insincerity, and disintegritive depravity of principle, in the
hackneyed victims of profusion, as in the unfeeling children of
parsimony. I have every possible reverence for the much-talked-of
world beyond the grave, and I wish that which piety believes, and
virtue deserves, may be all matter of fact. But in things belonging
to, and ter<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>minating in this present scene of existence, man has
serious and interesting business on hand. Whether a man shall shake
hands with welcome in the distinguished elevation of respect, or
shrink from contempt in the abject corner of insignificance; whether
he shall wanton under the tropic of plenty, at least enjoy himself in
the comfortable latitudes of easy convenience, or starve in the arctic
circle of dreary poverty; whether he shall rise in the manly
consciousness of a self-approving mind, or sink beneath a galling load
of regret and remorse&mdash;these are alternatives of the last moment.</p>

<p>You see how I preach. You used occasionally to sermonize too; I wish
you would, in charity, favour me with a sheet full in your own way. I
admire the close of a letter Lord Bolingbroke writes to Dean
Swift:&mdash;&#8220;Adieu dear Swift! with all thy faults I love thee entirely:
make an effort to love me with all mine!&#8221; Humble servant, and all that
trumpery, is now such a prostituted business, that honest friendship,
in her sincere way, must have recourse to her primitive,
simple,&mdash;farewell!</p>

<h3>TO MR. GEORGE LOCKHART,</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">Merchant, Glasgow.</span></h4>

<p>[Burns, more than any poet of the age, loved to write out copies of
his favourite poems, and present them to his friends: he sent &#8220;The
Falls of Bruar&#8221; to Mr. Lockhart.]</p>

<p class="sig"><i>Mauchline, 18th July, 1788.</i></p>

<p class="sig7"><span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,</p>

<p>I am just going for Nithsdale, else I would certainly have transcribed
some of my rhyming things for you. The Miss Baillies I have seen in
Edinburgh. &#8220;Fair and lovely are thy works, Lord God Almighty! Who
would not praise thee for these thy gifts in thy goodness to the sons
of men!&#8221; It needed not your fine taste to admire them. I declare, one
day I had the honour of dining at Mr. Baillie&#8217;s, I was almost in the
predicament of the children of Israel, when they could not look on
Moses&#8217; face for the glory that shone in it when he descended from
Mount Sinai.</p>

<p>I did once write a poetic address from the Falls of Bruar to his Grace
of Athole, when I was in the Highlands. When you return to Scotland,
let me know, and I will send such of my pieces as please myself best.
I return to Mauchline in about ten days.</p>

<h3>TO MR. PETER HILL.</h3>

<p>[Peter Hill was a bookseller in Edinburgh: David Ramsay, printer of
the Evening Courant: William Dunbar, an advocate, and president of a
club of Edinburgh wits; and Alexander Cunningham, a jeweller, who
loved mirth and wine.]</p>

<p class="sig7"><span class="smcap">My dear Hill,</span></p>

<p>I shall say nothing to your mad present&mdash;you have so long and often
been of important service to me, and I suppose you mean to go on
conferring obligations until I shall not be able to lift up my face
before you. In the mean time, as Sir Roger de Coverley, because it
happened to be a cold day in which he made his will, ordered his
servants great coats for mourning, so, because I have been this week
plagued with an indigestion, I have sent you by the carrier a fine old
ewe-milk cheese.</p>

<p>Indigestion is the devil: nay, &#8217;tis the devil and all. It besets a man
in every one of his senses. I lose my appetite at the sight of
successful knavery, and sicken to loathing at the noise and nonsense
of self-important folly. When the hollow-hearted wretch takes me by
the hand, the feeling spoils my dinner: the proud man&#8217;s wine so
offends my palate that it chokes me in the gullet; and the
<i>pulvilised</i>, feathered, pert coxcomb is so disgustful in my nostril
that my stomach turns.</p>

<p>If ever you have any of these disagreeable sensations, let me
prescribe for you patience; and a bit of my cheese. I know that you
are no niggard of your good things among your friends, and some of
them are in much need of a slice. There, in my eye is our friend
Smellie; a man positively of the first abilities and greatest strength
of mind, as well as one of the best hearts and keenest wits that I
have ever met with; when you see him, as, alas! he too is smarting at
the pinch of distressful circumstances, aggravated by the sneer of
contumelious greatness&mdash;a bit of my cheese alone will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span> not cure him,
but if you add a tankard of brown stout, and superadd a magnum of
right Oporto, you will see his sorrows vanish like the morning mist
before the summer sun.</p>

<p>Candlish, the earliest friend, except my only brother, that I have on
earth, and one of the worthiest fellows that ever any man called by
the name of friend, if a luncheon of my cheese would help to rid him
of some of his super-abundant modesty, you would do well to give it
him.</p>

<p>David,<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> with his <i>Courant</i>, comes, too, across my recollection, and
I beg you will help him largely from the said ewe-milk cheese, to
enable him to digest those bedaubing paragraphs with which he is
eternally larding the lean characters of certain great men in a
certain great town. I grant you the periods are very well turned; so,
a fresh egg is a very good thing, but when thrown at a man in a
pillory, it does not at all improve his figure, not to mention the
irreparable loss of the egg.</p>

<p>My facetious friend Dunbar I would wish also to be a partaker: not to
digest his spleen, for that he laughs off, but to digest his last
night&#8217;s wine at the last field-day of the Crochallan corps.<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a></p>

<p>Among our common friends I must not forget one of the dearest of
them&mdash;Cunningham. The brutality, insolence, and selfishness of a world
unworthy of having such a fellow as he is in it, I know sticks in his
stomach, and if you can help him to anything that will make him a
little easier on that score, it will be very obliging.</p>

<p>As to honest J&mdash;&mdash; S&mdash;&mdash;e, he is such a contented, happy man, that I
know not what can annoy him, except, perhaps, he may not have got the
better of a parcel of modest anecdotes which a certain poet gave him
one night at supper, the last time the said poet was in town.</p>

<p>Though I have mentioned so many men of law, I shall have nothing to do
with them professedly&mdash;the faculty are beyond my prescription. As to
their clients, that is another thing; God knows they have much to
digest!</p>

<p>The clergy I pass by; their profundity of erudition, and their
liberality of sentiment; their total want of pride, and their
detestation of hypocrisy, are so proverbially notorious as to place
them far, far above either my praise or censure.</p>

<p>I was going to mention a man of worth whom I have the honour to call
friend, the Laird of Craigdarroch; but I have spoken to the landlord
of the King&#8217;s-Arms inn here, to have at the next county meeting a
large ewe-milk cheese on the table, for the benefit of the
Dumfries-shire Whigs, to enable them to digest the Duke of
Queensberry&#8217;s late political conduct.</p>

<p>I have just this moment an opportunity of a private hand to Edinburgh,
as perhaps you would not digest double postage.</p>

<h3>TO ROBERT GRAHAM, ESQ.,</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">of Fintray</span>.</h4>

<p>[The filial and fraternal claims alluded to in this letter were
satisfied with about three hundred pounds, two hundred of which went
to his brother Gilbert&mdash;a sum which made a sad inroad on the money
arising from the second edition of his Poems.]</p>

<p class="sig7"><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>

<p>When I had the honour of being introduced to you at Athole-house, I
did not think so soon of asking a favour of you. When Lear, in
Shakspeare, asked Old Kent why he wished to be in his service, he
answers, &#8220;Because you have that in your face which I would fain call
master.&#8221; For some such reason, Sir, do I now solicit your patronage.
You know, I dare say, of an application I lately made to your Board to
be admitted an officer of Excise. I have, according to form, been
examined by a supervisor, and to-day I gave in his certificate, with a
request for an order for instructions. In this affair, if I succeed, I
am afraid I shall but too much need a patronizing friend. Propriety of
conduct as a man, and fidelity and attention as an officer, I dare
engage for; but with anything like business, except manual labour, I
am totally unacquainted.</p>

<p>I had intended to have closed my late appearance on the stage of life,
in the character of a country farmer; but after discharging some
filial and fraternal claims, I find I could only fight for existence
in that miserable manner, which I have lived to see throw a venerable
parent into the jaws of a jail; whence death, the poor man&#8217;s last and
often best friend, rescued him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span></p>

<p>I know, Sir, that to need your goodness, is to have a claim on it; may
I, therefore, beg your patronage to forward me in this affair, till I
be appointed to a division; where, by the help of rigid economy, I
will try to support that independence so dear to my soul, but which
has been too often so distant from my situation.</p>

<h3>TO WILLIAM CRUIKSHANK.</h3>

<p>[The verses which this letter conveyed to Cruikshank were the lines

<p class="sig"><i>Ellisland, August, 1788.</i></p>

<p>I have not room, my dear friend, to answer all the particulars of your
last kind letter. I shall be in Edinburgh on some business very soon;
and as I shall be two days, or perhaps three, in town, we shall
discuss matters <i>viv&acirc; voce.</i> My knee, I believe, will never be
entirely well; and an unlucky fall this winter has made it still
worse. I well remember the circumstance you allude to, respecting
Creech&#8217;s opinion of Mr. Nicol; but, as the first gentleman owes me
still about fifty pounds, I dare not meddle in the affair.</p>

<p>It gave me a very heavy heart to read such accounts of the consequence
of your quarrel with that puritanic, rotten-hearted, hell-commissioned
scoundrel A&mdash;&mdash;. If, notwithstanding your unprecedented industry in
public, and your irreproachable conduct in private life, he still has
you so much in his power, what ruin may he not bring on some others I
could name?</p>

<p>Many and happy returns of seasons to you, with your dearest and
worthiest friend, and the lovely little pledge of your happy union.
May the great Author of life, and of every enjoyment that can render
life delightful, make her that comfortable blessing to you both, which
you so ardently wish for, and which, allow me to say, you so well
deserve! Glance over the foregoing verses, and let me have your blots.</p>

<p class="sig7"><span class="smcap">Honoured Madam</span>,</p>

<p>Your kind letter welcomed me, yesternight, to Ayrshire. I am, indeed,
seriously angry with you at the quantum of your luckpenny; but, vexed
and hurt as I was, I could not help laughing very heartily at the
noble lord&#8217;s apology for the missed napkin.</p>

<p>I would write you from Nithsdale, and give you my direction there, but
I have scarce an opportunity of calling at a post-office once in a
fortnight. I am six miles from Dumfries, am scarcely ever in it
myself, and, as yet, have little acquaintance in the neighbourhood.
Besides, I am now very busy on my farm, building a dwelling-house; as
at present I am almost an evangelical man in Nithsdale, for I have
scarce &#8220;where to lay my head.&#8221;</p>

<p>There are some passages in your last that brought tears in my eyes.
&#8220;The heart knoweth its own sorrows, and a stranger intermeddleth not
therewith.&#8221; The repository of these &#8220;sorrows of the heart&#8221; is a kind
of <i>sanctum sanctorum:</i> and &#8217;tis only a chosen friend, and that, too,

<p>You will excuse this quotation for the sake of the author. Instead of
entering on this subject farther, I shall transcribe you a few lines I
wrote in a hermitage, belonging to a gentleman in my Nithsdale
neighbourhood. They are almost the only favours the muses have

<h3>TO MRS. DUNLOP.</h3>

<p>[This letter has been often cited, and very properly, as a proof of
the strong attachment of Burns to one who was, in many respects,
worthy.]</p>

<p class="sig"><i>Mauchline, August 10, 1788.</i></p>

<p class="sig7"><span class="smcap">My much honoured Friend,</span></p>

<p>Yours of the 24th June is before me. I found it, as well as another
valued friend&mdash;my wife, waiting to welcome me to Ayrshire: I met both
with the sincerest pleasure.</p>

<p>When I write you, Madam, I do not sit down to answer every paragraph
of yours, by echoing every sentiment, like the faithful Commons of
Great Britain in Parliament assembled, answering a speech from the
best of kings! I express myself in the fulness of my heart, and may,
perhaps, be guilty of neglecting some of your kind inquiries; but not
from your very old reason, that I do not read your letters. All your
epistles for several months have cost me nothing, except a swelling
throb of gratitude, or a deep-felt sentiment of veneration.</p>

<p>When Mrs. Burns, Madam, first found herself &#8220;as women wish to be who
love their lords,&#8221; as I loved her nearly to distraction, we took steps
for a private marriage. Her parents got the hint; and not only forbade
me her company and their house, but, on my rumoured West Indian
voyage, got a warrant to put me in jail, till I should find security
in my about-to-be paternal relation. You know my lucky reverse of
fortune. On my <i>&eacute;clatant</i> return to Mauchline, I was made very welcome
to visit my girl. The usual consequences began to betray her; and, as
I was at that time laid up a cripple in Edinburgh, she was turned,
literally turned out of doors, and I wrote to a friend to shelter her
till my return, when our marriage was declared. Her happiness or
misery were in my hands, and who could trifle with such a deposit?</p>

<p>I can easily fancy a more agreeable companion for my journey of life;
but, upon my honour, I have never seen the individual instance.</p>

<p>Circumstanced as I am, I could never have got a female partner for
life, who could have entered into my favourite studies, relished my
favourite authors, &amp;c., without probably entailing on me at the same
time expensive living, fantastic caprice, perhaps apish affectation,
with all the other blessed boarding-school acquirements, which
(<i>pardonnez moi, Madame</i>,) are sometimes to be found among females of
the upper ranks, but almost universally pervade the misses of the
would-be gentry.</p>

<p>I like your way in your church-yard lucubrations. Thoughts that are
the spontaneous result of accidental situations, either respecting
health, place, or company, have often a strength, and always an
originality, that would in vain be looked for in fancied circumstances
and studied paragraphs. For me, I have often thought of keeping a
letter, in progression by me, to send you when the sheet was written
out. Now I talk of sheets, I must tell you, my reason for writing to
you on paper of this kind is my pruriency of writing to you at large.
A page of post is on such a dissocial, narrow-minded scale,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span> that I
cannot abide it; and double letters, at least in my miscellaneous
revery manner, are a monstrous tax in a close correspondence.</p>

<p>[Mrs. Miller, of Dalswinton, was a lady of beauty and talent: she
wrote verses with skill and taste. Her maiden name was Jean Lindsay.]</p>

<p class="sig"><i>Ellisland, 16th August, 1788.</i></p>

<p>I am in a fine disposition, my honoured friend, to send you an elegiac
epistle; and want only genius to make it quite Shenstonian:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;Why droops my heart with fancied woes forlorn?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why sinks my soul, beneath each wintry sky?&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>My increasing cares in this, as yet strange country&mdash;gloomy
conjectures in the dark vista of futurity&mdash;consciousness of my own
inability for the struggle of the world&mdash;my broadened mark to
misfortune in a wife and children;&mdash;I could indulge these reflections
till my humour should ferment into the most acid chagrin, that would
corrode the very thread of life.</p>

<p>To counterwork these baneful feelings, I have sat down to write to
you; as I declare upon my soul I always find that the most sovereign
balm for my wounded spirit.</p>

<p>I was yesterday at Mr. Miller&#8217;s to dinner for the first time. My
reception was quite to my mind: from the lady of the house quite
flattering. She sometimes hits on a couplet or two, <i>impromptu.</i> She
repeated one or two to the admiration of all present. My suffrage as a
professional man, was expected: I for once went agonizing over the
belly of my conscience. Pardon me, ye my adored household gods,
independence of spirit, and integrity of soul! In the course of
conversation, &#8220;Johnson&#8217;s Musical Museum,&#8221; a collection of Scottish
songs with the music, was talked of. We got a song on the harpsichord,
beginning,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;Raving winds around her blowing.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The air was much admired: the lady of the house asked me whose were
the words. &#8220;Mine, Madam&mdash;they are indeed my very best verses;&#8221; she
took not the smallest notice of them! The old Scottish proverb says
well, &#8220;king&#8217;s caff is better than ither folks&#8217; corn.&#8221; I was going to
make a New Testament quotation about &#8220;casting pearls&#8221; but that would
be too virulent, for the lady is actually a woman of sense and taste.</p>

<p>After all that has been said on the other side of the question, man is
by no means a happy creature. I do not speak of the selected few,
favoured by partial heaven, whose souls are tuned to gladness amid
riches and honours, and prudence and wisdom. I speak of the neglected
many, whose nerves, whose sinews, whose days are sold to the minions
of fortune.</p>

<p>If I thought you had never seen it, I would transcribe for you a
stanza of an old Scottish ballad, called, &#8220;The Life and Age of Man;&#8221;
beginning thus:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;&#8217;Twas in the sixteenth hunder year<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of God and fifty-three,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Frae Christ was born, that bought us dear,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">As writings testifie.&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>I had an old grand-uncle, with whom my mother lived awhile in her
girlish years; the good old man, for such he was, was long blind ere
he died, during which time his highest enjoyment was to sit down and
cry, while my mother would sing the simple old song of &#8220;the Life and
Age of Man.&#8221;</p>

<p>It is this way of thinking; it is these melancholy truths, that make
religion so precious to the poor, miserable children of men.&mdash;If it is
a mere phantom, existing only in the heated imagination of enthusiasm,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;What truth on earth so precious as a lie.&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>My idle reasonings sometimes make me a little sceptical, but the
necessities of my heart always give the cold philosophisings the lie.
Who looks for the heart weaned from earth; the soul affianced to her
God; the correspondent devout thanksgiving, constant as the
vicissitudes of even and morn; who thinks to meet with these in the
court, the palace, in the glare of public life? No: to find them in
their precious importance and divine efficacy, we must search among
the obscure recesses of disappointment, affliction, poverty, and
distress.</p>

<p>I am sure, dear Madam, you are now more than pleased with the length
of my letters. I return to Ayrshire middle of next week: and it
quickens my pace to think that there will be a letter from you waiting
me there. I must be here again very soon for my harvest.</p>

<h3>TO MR. BEUGO,</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">Engraver, Edinburgh.</span></h4>

<p>[Mr. Beugo was at well-known engraver in Edinburgh: he engraved
Nasmyth&#8217;s portrait of Burns, for Creech&#8217;s first edition of his Poems;
and as he could draw a little, he improved, as he called it, the
engraving from sittings of the poet, and made it a little more like,
and a little less poetic.]</p>

<p class="sig"><i>Ellisland, 9th Sept. 1788.</i></p>

<p class="sig7"><span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,</p>

<p>There is not in Edinburgh above the number of the graces whose letters
would have given me so much pleasure as yours of the 3d instant, which
only reached me yesternight.</p>

<p>I am here on the farm, busy with my harvest; but for all that most
pleasurable part of life called <span class="smcap">social communication</span>, I am
here at the very elbow of existence. The only things that are to be
found in this country, in any degree of perfection, are stupidity and
canting. Prose they only know in graces, prayers, &amp;c., and the value
of these they estimate as they do their plaiding webs&mdash;by the ell! As
for the muses, they have as much an idea of a rhinoceros as of a poet.
For my old capricious but good-natured huzzy of a muse&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;By banks of Nith I sat and wept<br /></span>
<span class="i2">When Coila I thought on,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In midst thereof I hung my harp<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The willow-trees upon.&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>I am generally about half my time in Ayrshire with my &#8220;darling Jean,&#8221;
and then I, at lucid intervals, throw my horny fist across my
becob-webbed lyre, much in the same manner as an old wife throws her
hand across the spokes of her spinning-wheel.</p>

<p>I will send you the &#8220;Fortunate Shepherdess&#8221; as soon as I return to
Ayrshire, for there I keep it with other precious treasure. I shall
send it by a careful hand, as I would not for anything it should be
mislaid or lost. I do not wish to serve you from any benevolence, or
other grave Christian virtue; &#8217;tis purely a selfish gratification of
my own feelings whenever I think of you.</p>

<p>If your better functions would give you leisure to write me, I should
be extremely happy; that is to say if you neither keep nor look for a
regular correspondence. I hate the idea of being obliged to write a
letter. I sometimes write a friend twice a week, at other times once a
quarter.</p>

<p>I am exceedingly pleased with your fancy in making the author you
mention place a map of Iceland instead of his portrait before his
works: &#8217;twas a glorious idea.</p>

<p>Could you conveniently do me one thing?&mdash;whenever you finish any head
I should like to have a proof copy of it. I might tell you a long
story about your fine genius; but as what everybody knows cannot have
escaped you, I shall not say one syllable about it.</p>

<h3>TO MISS CHALMERS,</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">Edinburgh</span>.</h4>

<p>[To this fine letter all the biographer of Burns are largely
indebted.]</p>

<p class="sig"><i>Ellisland, near Dumfries, Sept. 16th, 1788.</i></p>

<p>Where are you? and how are you? and is Lady Mackenzie recovering her
health? for I have had but one solitary letter from you. I will not
think you have forgot me, Madam; and for my part&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;When thee, Jerusalem, I forget,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Skill part from my right hand!&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>&#8220;My heart is not of that rock, nor my soul careless as that sea.&#8221; I do
not make my progress among mankind as a bowl does among its
fellows&mdash;rolling through the crowd without bearing away any mark of
impression, except where they hit in hostile collision.</p>

<p>I am here, driven in with my harvest-folks by bad weather; and as you
and your sister once did me the honour of interesting yourselves much
<i>&agrave; l&#8217;&eacute;gard de moi</i>, I sit down to beg the continuation of your
goodness. I can truly say that, all the exterior of life apart, I
never saw two, whose esteem flattered the nobler feelings of my
soul&mdash;I will not say more, but so much as Lady Mackenzie and Miss
Chalmers. When I think of you&mdash;hearts the best, minds the noblest of
human kind&mdash;unfortunate even in the shades of life&mdash;when I think I
have met with you, and have lived more of real life with you in eight
days than I can do with almost any body I meet with in eight
years&mdash;when I think on the improbability of meeting you in this world
again&mdash;I could sit down and cry like a child! If ever you honoured me
with a place in your esteem, I trust I can now plead more<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span> desert. I
am secure against that crushing grip of iron poverty, which, alas! is
less or more fatal to the native worth and purity of, I fear, the
noblest souls; and a late important step in my life has kindly taken
me out of the way of those ungrateful iniquities, which, however
overlooked in fashionable license, or varnished in fashionable phrase,
are indeed but lighter and deeper shades of <span class="smcap">villany</span>.</p>

<p>Shortly after my last return to Ayrshire, I married &#8220;my Jean.&#8221; This
was not in consequence of the attachment of romance, perhaps; but I
had a long and much-loved fellow-creature&#8217;s happiness or misery in my
determination, and I durst not trifle with so important a deposit. Nor
have I any cause to repent it. If I have not got polite tattle, modish
manners, and fashionable dress, I am not sickened and disgusted with
the multiform curse of boarding-school affectation: and I have got the
handsomest figure, the sweetest temper, the soundest constitution, and
the kindest heart in the county. Mrs. Burns believes, as firmly as her
creed, that I am <i>le plus bel esprit, et le plus honn&ecirc;te homme</i> in the
universe; although she scarcely ever in her life, except the
Scriptures of the Old and New Testament, and the Psalms of David in
metre, spent five minutes together either on prose or verse. I must
except also from this last a certain late publication of Scots poems,
which she has perused very devoutly; and all the ballads in the
country, as she has (O the partial lover! you will cry) the finest
&#8220;wood-note wild&#8221; I ever heard. I am the more particular in this lady&#8217;s
character, as I know she will henceforth have the honour of a share in
your best wishes. She is still at Mauchline, as I am building my
house; for this hovel that I shelter in, while occasionally here, is
pervious to every blast that blows, and every shower that falls; and I
am only preserved from being chilled to death by being suffocated with
smoke. I do not find my farm that pennyworth I was taught to expect,
but I believe, in time, it may be a saving bargain. You will be
pleased to hear that I have laid aside idle <i>&eacute;clat</i>, and bind every
day after my reapers.</p>

<p>To save me from that horrid situation of at any time going down in a
losing bargain of a farm, to misery, I have taken my Excise
instructions, and have my commission in my pocket for any emergency of
fortune. If I could set all before your view, whatever disrespect you,
in common with the world, have for this business, I know you would
approve of my idea.</p>

<p>I will make no apology, dear Madam, for this egotistic detail; I know
you and your sister will be interested in every circumstance of it.
What signify the silly, idle gewgaws of wealth, or the ideal trumpery
of greatness! When fellow-partakers of the same nature fear the same
God, have the same benevolence of heart, the same nobleness of soul,
the same detestation at everything dishonest, and the same scorn at
everything unworthy&mdash;if they are not in the dependence of absolute
beggary, in the name of common sense are they not <span class="smcap">equals</span>? And
if the bias, the instinctive bias, of their souls run the same way,
why may they not be <span class="smcap">friends</span>?</p>

<p>When I may have an opportunity of sending you this, Heaven only knows.
Shenstone says, &#8220;When one is confined idle within doors by bad
weather, the best antidote against <i>ennui</i> is to read the letters of
or write to, one&#8217;s friends;&#8221; in that case then, if the weather
continues thus, I may scrawl you half a quire.</p>

<p>I very lately&mdash;to wit, since harvest began&mdash;wrote a poem, not in
imitation, but in the manner, of Pope&#8217;s Moral Epistles. It is only a
short essay, just to try the strength of my muse&#8217;s pinion in that way.
I will send you a copy of it, when once I have heard from you. I have
likewise been laying the foundation of some pretty large poetic works:
how the superstructure will come on, I leave to that great maker and
marrer of projects&mdash;<span class="smcap">time</span>. Johnson&#8217;s collection of Scots songs
is going on in the third volume; and, of consequence, finds me a
consumpt for a great deal of idle metre. One of the most tolerable
things I have done in that way is two stanzas I made to an air, a
musical gentleman of my acquaintance composed for the anniversary of
his wedding-day, which happens on the seventh of November. Take it as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;The day returns&mdash;my bosom burns,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The blissful day we twa did meet,&#8221; &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>I shall give over this letter for shame. If I should be seized with a
scribbling fit, before this goes away, I shall make it another letter;
and then you may allow your patience a week&#8217;s respite between the two.
I have not room for more than the old, kind, hearty farewell.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span></p><hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>To make some amends, <i>mes ch&egrave;res Mesdames</i>, for dragging you on to
this second sheet, and to relieve a little the tiresomeness of my
unstudied and uncorrectible prose, I shall transcribe you some of my
late poetic bagatelles; though I have, these eight or ten months, done
very little that way. One day in a hermitage on the banks of Nith,
belonging to a gentleman in my neighbourhood, who is so good as give
me a key at pleasure, I wrote as follows; supposing myself the
sequestered, venerable inhabitant of the lonely mansion.</p>

<p>Necessity obliges me to go into my new house even before it be

About three weeks more, I think, will at farthest be my time, beyond
which I cannot stay in this present house. If ever you wished to

<h4><span class="smcap">of Dunlop</span>.</h4>

<p>[Burns had no great respect for critics who found blemishes without
perceiving beauties: he expresses his contempt for such in this
letter.]</p>

<p class="sig"><i>Mauchline, 27th Sept. 1788.</i></p>

<p>I have received twins, dear Madam, more than once; but scarcely ever
with more pleasure than when I received yours of the 12th instant. To
make myself understood; I had wrote to Mr. Graham, enclosing my poem
addressed to him, and the same post which favoured me with yours
brought me an answer from him. It was dated the very day he had
received mine; and I am quite at a loss to say whether it was most
polite or kind.</p>

<p>Your criticisms, my honoured benefactress, are truly the work of a
friend. They are not the blasting depredations of a canker-toothed,
caterpillar critic; nor are they the fair statement of cold
impartiality, balancing with unfeeling exactitude the <i>pro</i> and <i>con</i>
of an author&#8217;s merits; they are the judicious observations of animated
friendship, selecting the beauties of the piece. I have just arrived
from Nithsdale, and will be here a fortnight. I was on horseback this
morning by three o&#8217;clock; for between my wife and my farm is just
forty-six miles. As I jogged on in the dark, I was taken with a poetic
fit as follows:</p>

<p>&#8220;Mrs. Ferguson of Craigdarroch&#8217;s lamentation for the death of her son;
an uncommonly promising youth of eighteen or nineteen years of age.&#8221;</p>

</div></div>

<p>You will not send me your poetic rambles, but, you see I am no niggard
of mine. I am sure your impromptus give me double pleasure; what falls
from your pen can neither be unentertaining in itself, nor indifferent
to me.</p>

<p>The one fault you found, is just; but I cannot please myself in an
emendation.</p>

<p>What a life of solicitude is the life of a parent! You interested me
much in your young couple.</p>

<p>I would not take my folio paper for this epistle, and now I repent it.
I am so jaded with my dirty long journey that I was afraid to drawl
into the essence of dulness with anything <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>larger than a quarto, and
so I must leave out another rhyme of this morning&#8217;s manufacture.</p>

<h3>TO MR. PETER HILL.</h3>

<p>[&#8220;The &#8216;Address to Lochlomond,&#8217; which this letter criticises,&#8221; says
Currie in 1800, &#8220;was written by a gentleman, now one of the masters of
the High-school of Edinburgh, and the same who translated the
beautiful story of &#8216;The Paria,&#8217; published in the Bee of Dr.
Anderson.&#8221;]</p>

<p class="sig"><i>Mauchline, 1st October, 1788.</i></p>

<p>I have been here in this country about three days, and all that time
my chief reading has been the &#8220;Address to Lochlomond&#8221; you were so
obliging as to send to me. Were I impannelled one of the author&#8217;s
jury, to determine his criminality respecting the sin of poesy, my
verdict should be &#8220;guilty! a poet of nature&#8217;s making!&#8221;. It is an
excellent method for improvement, and what I believe every poet does,
to place some favourite classic author in his own walks of study and
composition, before him as a model. Though your author had not
mentioned the name, I could have, at half a glance, guessed his model
to be Thomson. Will my brother-poet forgive me, if I venture to hint
that his imitation of that immortal bard is in two or three places
rather more servile than such a genius as his required:&mdash;<i>e.g.</i></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;To soothe the maddening passions all to peace.&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="sig2"><span class="smcap">Address.</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;To soothe the throbbing passions into peace.&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="sig2"><span class="smcap">Thomson.</span></p>

<p>I think the &#8220;Address&#8221; is in simplicity, harmony, and elegance of
versification, fully equal to the &#8220;Seasons.&#8221; Like Thomson, too, he has
looked into nature for himself: you meet with no copied description.
One particular criticism I made at first reading; in no one instance
has he said too much. He never flags in his progress, but, like a true
poet of nature&#8217;s making kindles in his course. His beginning is simple
and modest, as if distrustful of the strength of his pinion; only, I
do not altogether like&mdash;</p>

<span class="i0">The soul of every song that&#8217;s nobly great.&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Fiction is the soul of many a song that is nobly great. Perhaps I am
wrong: this may be but a prose criticism. Is not the phrase in line 7,
page 6, &#8220;Great lake,&#8221; too much vulgarized by every-day language for so
sublime a poem?</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;Great mass of waters, theme for nobler song,&#8221;<br /></span>

<p>is perhaps no emendation. His enumeration of a comparison with other
lakes is at once harmonious and poetic. Every reader&#8217;s ideas must
sweep the</p>

<p>The perspective that follows mountains blue&mdash;the imprisoned billows
beating in vain&mdash;the wooded isles&mdash;the digression on the
yew-tree&mdash;&#8220;Ben-lomond&#8217;s lofty, cloud-envelop&#8217;d head,&#8221; &amp;c. are
beautiful. A thunder-storm is a subject which has been often tried,
yet our poet in his grand picture has interjected a circumstance, so
far as I know, entirely original:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>

<p>In his preface to the Storm, &#8220;the glens how dark between,&#8221; is noble
highland landscape! The &#8220;rain ploughing the red mould,&#8221; too, is
beautifully fancied. &#8220;Ben-lomond&#8217;s lofty, pathless top,&#8221; is a good
expression; and the surrounding view from it is truly great: the</p>

<span class="i0">Beneath the beaming sun,&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>is well described; and here he has contrived to enliven his poem with
a little of that passion which bids fair, I think, to usurp the modern
muses altogether. I know not how far this episode is a beauty upon the
whole, but the swain&#8217;s wish to carry &#8220;some faint idea of the vision
bright,&#8221; to entertain her &#8220;partial listening ear,&#8221; is a pretty
thought. But in my opinion the most beautiful passages in the whole
poem are the fowls crowding, in wintry frosts, to Lochlomond&#8217;s
&#8220;hospitable flood;&#8221; their wheeling round, their lighting, mixing,
diving, &amp;c.; and the glorious description of the sportsman. This last
is equal to anything in the &#8220;Seasons.&#8221; The idea of &#8220;the floating tribe
distant seen, far glistering to the moon,&#8221; provoking his eye as he is
obliged to leave them, is a noble ray of poetic genius. &#8220;The howling
winds,&#8221; the &#8220;hideous roar&#8221; of the white cascades, are all in the same
style.</p>

<p>I forget that while I am thus holding forth with the heedless warmth
of an enthusiast, I am perhaps tiring you with nonsense. I must,
however, mention that the last verse of the sixteenth page is one of
the most elegant compli<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>ments I have ever seen. I must likewise notice
that beautiful paragraph beginning, &#8220;The gleaming lake,&#8221; &amp;c. I dare
not go into the particular beauties of the last two paragraphs, but
they are admirably fine, and truly Ossianic.</p>

<p>I must beg your pardon for this lengthened scrawl. I had no idea of it
when I began&mdash;I should like to know who the author is; but, whoever he
be, please present him with my grateful thanks for the entertainment
he has afforded me.</p>

on the Religion essential to Man,&#8221; a book you sent me before; and &#8220;The
World unmasked, or the Philosopher the greatest Cheat.&#8221; Send me them

<h3>TO THE EDITOR OF &#8220;THE STAR.&#8221;</h3>

<p>[The clergyman who preached the sermon which this letter condemns, was
a man equally worthy and stern&mdash;a divine of Scotland&#8217;s elder day: he
received &#8220;a harmonious call&#8221; to a smaller stipend than that of
Dunscore&mdash;and accepted it.]</p>

<p class="sig"><i>November 8th, 1788.</i></p>

<p class="sig7"><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the opprobrious epithets with which some of our
philosophers and gloomy sectarians have branded our nature&mdash;the
principle of universal selfishness, the proneness to all evil, they
have given us; still the detestation in which inhumanity to the
distressed, or insolence to the fallen, are held by all mankind, shows
that they are not natives of the human heart. Even the unhappy partner
of our kind, who is undone, the bitter consequence of his follies or
his crimes, who but sympathizes with the miseries of this ruined
profligate brother? We forget the injuries and feel for the man.</p>

<p>I went, last Wednesday, to my parish church, most cordially to join in
grateful acknowledgment to the <span class="smcap">Author of all Good</span>, for the
consequent blessings of the glorious revolution. To that auspicious
event we owe no less than our liberties, civil and religious; to it we
are likewise indebted for the present Royal Family, the ruling
features of whose administration have ever been mildness to the
subject, and tenderness of his rights.</p>

<p>Bred and educated in revolution principles, the principles of reason
and common sense, it could not be any silly political prejudice which
made my heart revolt at the harsh abusive manner in which the reverend
gentleman mentioned the House of Stewart, and which, I am afraid, was
too much the language of the day. We may rejoice sufficiently in our
deliverance from past evils, without cruelly raking up the ashes of
those whose misfortune it was, perhaps as much as their crime, to be
the authors of those evils; and we may bless God for all his goodness
to us as a nation, without at the same time cursing a few ruined,
powerless exiles, who only harboured ideas, and made attempts, that
most of us would have done, had we been in their situation.</p>

<p>&#8220;The bloody and tyrannical House of Stewart&#8221; may be said with
propriety and justice, when compared with the present royal family,
and the sentiments of our days; but is there no allowance to be made
for the manners of the times? Were the royal contemporaries of the
Stewarts more attentive to their subjects&#8217; rights? Might not the
epithets of &#8220;bloody and tyrannical&#8221; be, with at least equal justice,
applied to the House of Tudor, of York, or any other of their
predecessors?</p>

<p>The simple state of the case, Sir, seems to be this:&mdash;At that period,
the science of government, the knowledge of the true relation between
king and subject, was, like other sciences and other knowledge, just
in its infancy, emerging from dark ages of ignorance and barbarity.</p>

<p>The Stewarts only contended for prerogatives which they knew their
predecessors enjoyed, and which they saw their contemporaries
enjoying; but these prerogatives were inimical to the happiness of a
nation and the rights of subjects.</p>

<p>In the contest between prince and people, the consequence of that
light of science which had lately dawned over Europe, the monarch of
France, for example, was victorious over the struggling liberties of
his people: with us, luckily the monarch failed, and his unwarrantable
pretensions fell a sacrifice to our rights and happiness. Whether it
was owing to the wisdom of leading individuals, or to the justling
of parties, I cannot pretend to determine; but likewise happily for
us, the kingly power was shifted into another branch of the family,
who, as they owed the throne solely to the call<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span> of a free people,
could claim nothing inconsistent with the covenanted terms which
placed them there.</p>

<p>The Stewarts have been condemned and laughed at for the folly and
impracticability of their attempts in 1715 and 1745. That they failed,
I bless <span class="smcap">God</span>; but cannot join in the ridicule against them.
Who does not know that the abilities or defects of leaders and
commanders are often hidden until put to the touchstone of exigency;
and that there is a caprice of fortune, an omnipotence in particular
accidents and conjunctures of circumstances, which exalt us as heroes,
or brand us as madmen, just as they are for or against us?</p>

<p>Man, Mr. Publisher, is a strange, weak, inconsistent being; who would
believe, Sir, that in this our Augustan age of liberality and
refinement, while we seem so justly sensible and jealous of our rights
and liberties, and animated with such indignation against the very
memory of those who would have subverted them&mdash;that a certain people
under our national protection should complain, not against our monarch
and a few favorite advisers, but against our <span class="smcap">whole legislative
body</span>, for similar oppression, and almost in the very same terms,
as our forefathers did of the house of Stewart! I will not, I cannot
enter into the merits of the cause; but I dare say the American
Congress, in 1776, will be allowed to be as able and as enlightened as
the English Convention was in 1688; and that their posterity will
celebrate the centenary of their deliverance from us, as duly and
sincerely as we do ours from the oppressive measures of the
wrong-headed House of Stewart.</p>

<p>To conclude, Sir; let every man who has a tear for the many miseries
incident to humanity feel for a family illustrious as any in Europe,
and unfortunate beyond historic precedent; and let every Briton (and
particularly every Scotsman) who ever looked with reverential pity on
the dotage of a parent, cast a veil over the fatal mistakes of the
kings of his forefathers.</p>

<p>I had the very great pleasure of dining at Dunlop yesterday. Men are
said to flatter women because they are weak; if it is so, poets must
be weaker still; for Misses R. and K. and Miss G. M&#8217;K., with their
flattering attentions, and artful compliments, absolutely turned my
head. I own they did not lard me over as many a poet does his patron,
but they so intoxicated me with their sly insinuations and delicate
inuendos of compliment, that if it had not been for a lucky
recollection, how much additional weight and lustre your good opinion
and friendship must give me in that circle, I had certainly looked
upon myself as a person of no small consequence. I dare not say one
word how much I was charmed with the Major&#8217;s friendly welcome, elegant
manner, and acute remark, lest I should be thought to overbalance my
orientalisms of applause over-against the finest quey<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> in Ayrshire,
which he made me a present of to help and adorn my farm-stock. As it
was on hallow-day, I am determined annually, as that day returns, to
decorate her horns with an ode of gratitude to the family of Dunlop.</p>

<p>So soon as I know of your arrival at Dunlop, I will take the first
conveniency to dedicate a day, or perhaps two, to you and friendship,
under the guarantee of the Major&#8217;s hospitality. There will soon be
threescore and ten miles of permanent distance between us; and now
that your friendship and friendly correspondence is entwisted with the
heart-strings of my enjoyment of life, I must indulge myself in a
happy day of &#8220;The feast of reason and the flow of soul.&#8221;</p>

<p>[James Johnson, though not an ungenerous man, meanly refused to give a
copy of the Musical Museum to Burns, who desired to bestow it on one
to whom his family was deeply indebted. This was in the last year of
the poet&#8217;s life, and after the Museum had been brightened by so much
of his lyric verse.]</p>

<p class="sig"><i>Mauchline, November 15th, 1788.</i></p>

<p class="sig7"><span class="smcap">My dear Sir,</span></p>

<p>I have sent you two more songs. If you have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span> got any tunes, or
anything to correct, please send them by return of the carrier.</p>

<p>I can easily see, my dear friend, that you will very probably have
four volumes. Perhaps you may not find your account lucratively in
this business; but you are a patriot for the music of your country;
and I am certain posterity will look on themselves as highly indebted
to your public spirit. Be not in a hurry; let us go on correctly, and
your name shall be immortal.</p>

<p>I am preparing a flaming preface for your third volume. I see every

hunted butterflies of a day, and then vanish for ever: but your work
will outlive the momentary neglects of idle fashion, and defy the
teeth of time.</p>

<p class="sig"><i>Mauchline, November 15th, 1788.</i></p>

<p class="sig7"><span class="smcap">Reverend and dear Sir</span>,</p>

<p>As I hear nothing of your motions, but that you are, or were, out of
town, I do not know where this may find you, or whether it will find
you at all. I wrote you a long letter, dated from the land of
matrimony, in June; but either it had not found you, or, what I dread
more, it found you or Mrs. Blacklock in too precarious a state of
health and spirits to take notice of an idle packet.</p>

<p>I have done many little things for Johnson, since I had the pleasure
of seeing you; and I have finished one piece, in the way of Pope&#8217;s
&#8220;Moral Epistles;&#8221; but, from your silence, I have everything to fear,
so I have only sent you two melancholy things, which I tremble lest
they should too well suit the tone of your present feelings.</p>

<p>In a fortnight I move, bag and baggage, to Nithsdale; till then, my
direction is at this place; after that period, it will be at
Ellisland, near Dumfries. It would extremely oblige me, were it but
half a line, to let me know how you are, and where you are. Can I be
indifferent to the fate of a man to whom I owe so much? A man whom I
not only esteem, but venerate.</p>

<p>My warmest good wishes and most respectful compliments to Mrs.
Blacklock, and Miss Johnston, if she is with you.</p>

<p>I cannot conclude without telling you that I am more and more pleased
with the step I took respecting &#8220;my Jean.&#8221; Two things, from my happy
experience, I set down as apothegms in life. A wife&#8217;s head is

<p class="sig7"><span class="smcap">My dear honoured Friend</span>,</p>

<p>Yours, dated Edinburgh, which I have just read, makes me very unhappy.
&#8220;Almost blind and wholly deaf,&#8221; are melancholy news of human nature;
but when told of a much-loved and honoured friend, they carry misery
in the sound. Goodness on your part, and gratitude on mine, began a
tie which has gradually entwisted itself among the dearest chords of
my bosom, and I tremble at the omens of your late and present ailing
habit and shattered health. You miscalculate matters widely, when you
forbid my waiting on you, lest it should hurt my worldly concerns. My
small scale of farming is exceedingly more simple and easy than what
you have lately seen at Moreham Mains. But, be that as it may, the
heart of the man and the fancy of the poet are the two grand
considerations for which I live: if miry ridges and dirty dunghills
are to engross the best part of the functions of my soul immortal, I
had better been a rook or a magpie at once, and then I should<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span> not
have been plagued with any ideas superior to breaking of clods and
picking up grubs; not to mention barn-door cocks or mallards,
creatures with which I could almost exchange lives at any time. If you
continue so deaf, I am afraid a visit will be no great pleasure to
either of us; but if I hear you are got so well again as to be able to
relish conversation, look you to it, Madam, for I will make my
threatenings good. I am to be at the New-year-day fair of Ayr; and, by
all that is sacred in the world, friend, I will come and see you.</p>

<p>Your meeting, which you so well describe, with your old schoolfellow
and friend, was truly interesting. Out upon the ways of the
world!&mdash;They spoil &#8220;these social offsprings of the heart.&#8221; Two
veterans of the &#8220;men of the world&#8221; would have met with little more
heart-workings than two old hacks worn out on the road. Apropos, is
not the Scotch phrase, &#8220;Auld lang syne,&#8221; exceedingly expressive? There
is an old song and tune which has often thrilled through my soul. You
know I am an enthusiast in old Scotch songs. I shall give you the
verses on the other sheet, as I suppose Mr. Ker will save you the
postage.</p>

<p>[The Laird of Glenriddel informed &#8220;the charming, lovely Davies&#8221; that
Burns was composing a song in her praise. The poet acted on this, and

<p class="sig7"><span class="smcap">Madam</span>,</p>

<p>I understand my very worthy neighbour, Mr. Riddel, has informed you
that I have made you the subject of some verses. There is something
so provoking in the idea of being the burthen of a ballad, that I do
not think Job or Moses, though such patterns of patience and meekness,
could have resisted the curiosity to know what that ballad was: so my
worthy friend has done me a mischief, which I dare say he never
intended; and reduced me to the unfortunate alternative of leaving
your curiosity ungratified, or else disgusting you with foolish
verses, the unfinished production of a random moment, and never meant
to have met your ear. I have heard or read somewhere of a gentleman
who had some genius, much eccentricity, and very considerable
dexterity with his pencil. In the accidental group of life into which
one is thrown, wherever this gentleman met with a character in a more
than ordinary degree congenial to his heart, he used to steal a sketch
of the face, merely, he said, as a <i>nota bene</i>, to point out the
agreeable recollection to his memory. What this gentleman&#8217;s pencil was
to him, my muse is to me; and the verses I do myself the honour to
send you are a <i>memento</i> exactly of the same kind that he indulged in.</p>

<p>It may be more owing to the fastidiousness of my caprice than the
delicacy of my taste; but I am so often tired, disgusted and hurt with
insipidity, affectation, and pride of mankind, that when I meet with a
person &#8220;after my own heart,&#8221; I positively feel what an orthodox
Protestant would call a species of idolatry, which acts on my fancy
like inspiration; and I can no more desist rhyming on the impulse,
than an &AElig;olian harp can refuse its tones to the streaming air. A
distich or two would be the consequence, though the object which hit
my fancy were gray-bearded-age; but where my theme is youth and
beauty, a young lady whose personal charms, wit, and sentiment are
equally striking and unaffected&mdash;by heavens! though I had lived three
score years a married man, and three score years before I was a
married man, my imagination would hallow the very idea: and I am truly
sorry that the inclosed stanzas have done such poor justice to such a
subject.</p>

<p>I yesterday tried my cask of whiskey for the first time, and I assure
you it does you great<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span> credit. It will bear five waters strong; or six
ordinary toddy. The whiskey of this country is a most rascally liquor;
and, by consequence, only drank by the most rascally part of the
inhabitants. I am persuaded, if you once get a footing here, you might
do a great deal of business, in the way of consumpt; and should you
commence distiller again, this is the native barley country. I am
ignorant if, in your present way of dealing, you would think it worth
your while to extend your business so far as this country side. I
write you this on the account of an accident, which I must take the
merit of having partly designed to. A neighbour of mine, a John
Currie, miller in Carsemill&mdash;a man who is, in a word, a &#8220;very&#8221; good
man, even for a &pound;500 bargain&mdash;he and his wife were in my house the
time I broke open the cask. They keep a country public-house and sell
a great deal of foreign spirits, but all along thought that whiskey
would have degraded this house. They were perfectly astonished at my
whiskey, both for its taste and strength; and, by their desire, I
write you to know if you could supply them with liquor of an equal
quality, and what price. Please write me by first post, and direct to
me at Ellisland, near Dumfries. If you could take a jaunt this way
yourself, I have a spare spoon, knife and fork very much at your
service. My compliments to Mrs. Tennant, and all the good folks in

Presbyterian, that I approve of set times and seasons of more than
ordinary acts of devotion, for breaking in on that habitual routine of
life and thought, which is so apt to reduce our existence to a kind of
instinct, or even sometimes, and with some minds, to a state very
little superior to mere machinery.</p>

<p>This day, the first Sunday of May, a breezy, blue-skyed noon some time
about the beginning, and a hoary morning and calm sunny day about the
end, of autumn; these, time out of mind, have been with me a kind of
holiday.</p>

<p>I believe I owe this to that glorious paper in the Spectator, &#8220;The
Vision of Mirza,&#8221; a piece that struck my young fancy before I was
capable of fixing an idea to a word of three syllables: &#8220;On the 6th
day of the moon, which, according to the custom of my forefathers, I
always <i>keep holy</i>, after washing myself, and offering up my morning
devotions, I ascended the high hill of Bagdat, in order to pass the
rest of the day in meditation and prayer.&#8221;</p>

<p>We know nothing, or next to nothing, of the substance or structure of
our souls, so cannot account for those seeming caprices in them, that
one should be particularly pleased with this thing, or struck with
that, which, on minds of a different cast, makes no extraordinary
impression. I have some favourite flowers in spring, among which are
the mountain-daisy, the hare-bell, the fox-glove, the wild
brier-rose, the budding birch, and the hoary hawthorn, that I view and
hang over with particular delight. I never hear the loud solitary
whistle of the curlew in a summer noon, or the wild mixing cadence of
a troop of grey plovers, in an autumnal morning, without feeling an
elevation of soul like the enthusiasm of devotion or poetry. Tell me,
my dear friend, to what can this be owing? Are we a piece of
machinery, which, like the &AElig;olian harp, passive, takes the impression
of the passing accident? Or do these workings argue something within
us above the trodden clod? I own myself partial to such proofs of
those awful and important realities&mdash;a God that made all things&mdash;man&#8217;s
immaterial and immortal nature&mdash;and a world of weal or woe beyond
death and the grave.</p>

<h3>TO DR. MOORE.</h3>

<p>[The poet seems, in this letter, to perceive that Ellisland was not
the bargain he had reckoned it: he intimated,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span> as the reader will
remember, something of the same kind to Margaret Chalmers.]</p>

<p class="sig"><i>Ellisland, 4th Jan. 1789.</i></p>

<p class="sig7"><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>

<p>As often as I think of writing to you, which has been three or four
times every week these six months, it gives me something so like the
idea of an ordinary-sized statue offering at a conversation with the
Rhodian colossus, that my mind misgives me, and the affair always
miscarries somewhere between purpose and resolve. I have at last got
some business with you, and business letters are written by the
stylebook. I say my business is with you, Sir, for you never had any
with me, except the business that benevolence has in the mansion of
poverty.</p>

<p>The character and employment of a poet were formerly my pleasure, but
are now my pride. I know that a very great deal of my late eclat was
owing to the singularity of my situation, and the honest prejudice of
Scotsmen; but still, as I said in the preface to my first edition, I
do look upon myself as having some pretensions from Nature to the
poetic character. I have not a doubt but the knack, the aptitude, to
learn the muses&#8217; trade, is a gift bestowed by him &#8220;who forms the
secret bias of the soul;&#8221;&mdash;but I as firmly believe, that <i>excellence</i>
in the profession is the fruit of industry, labour, attention, and
pains. At least I am resolved to try my doctrine by the test of
experience. Another appearance from the press I put off to a very
distant day, a day that may never arrive&mdash;but poesy I am determined to
prosecute with all my vigour. Nature has given very few, if any, of
the profession, the talents of shining in every species of
composition. I shall try (for until trial it is impossible to know)
whether she has qualified me to shine in any one. The worst of it is,
by the time one has finished a piece, it has been so often viewed and
reviewed before the mental eye, that one loses, in a good measure, the
powers of critical discrimination. Here the best criterion I know is a
friend&mdash;not only of abilities to judge, but with good-nature enough,
like a prudent teacher with a young learner, to praise perhaps a
little more than is exactly just, lest the thin-skinned animal fall
into that most deplorable of all poetic diseases&mdash;heart-breaking
despondency of himself. Dare I, Sir, already immensely indebted to
your goodness, ask the additional obligation of your being that friend
to me? I enclose you an essay of mine in a walk of poesy to me
entirely new; I mean the epistle addressed to R. G. Esq. or Robert
Graham of Fintray, Esq., a gentleman of uncommon worth, to whom I lie
under very great obligations. The story of the poem, like most of my
poems, is connected with my own story, and to give you the one, I must
give you something of the other. I cannot boast of Mr. Creech&#8217;s
ingenuous fair dealing to me. He kept me hanging about Edinburgh from
the 7th August, 1787, until the 13th April, 1788, before he would
condescend to give me a statement of affairs; nor had I got it even
then, but for an angry letter I wrote him, which irritated his pride.
&#8220;I could&#8221; not a &#8220;tale&#8221; but a detail &#8220;unfold,&#8221; but what am I that
should speak against the Lord&#8217;s anointed Bailie of Edinburgh?</p>

<p>I believe I shall in the whole, 100<i>l.</i> copyright included, clear
about 400<i>l.</i> some little odds; and even part of this depends upon
what the gentleman has yet to settle with me. I give you this
information, because you did me the honour to interest yourself much
in my welfare. I give you this information, but I give it to yourself
only, for I am still much in the gentleman&#8217;s mercy. Perhaps I injure
the man in the idea I am sometimes tempted to have of him&mdash;God forbid
I should! A little time will try, for in a month I shall go to town to
wind up the business if possible.</p>

<p>To give the rest of my story in brief, I have married &#8220;my Jean,&#8221; and
taken a farm: with the first step I have every day more and more
reason to be satisfied: with the last, it is rather the reverse. I
have a younger brother, who supports my aged mother; another still
younger brother, and three sisters, in a farm. On my last return from
Edinburgh, it cost me about 180l. to save them from ruin. Not that I
have lost so much.&mdash;I only interposed between my brother and his
impending fate by the loan of so much. I give myself no airs on this,
for it was mere selfishness on my part: I was conscious that the wrong
scale of the balance was pretty heavily charged, and I thought that
throwing a little filial piety and fraternal affection into the scale
in my favour, might help to smooth matters at the <i>grand reckoning.</i>
There is still one thing would make my circumstances quite easy: I
have an excise officer&#8217;s commission, and I live in the midst of a
country division. My request to Mr. Graham, who is one of the
commissioners of excise, was, if in his power, to procure me that
division. If I were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span> very sanguine, I might hope that some of my great
patrons might procure me a Treasury warrant for supervisor,
surveyor-general, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Thus, secure of a livelihood, &#8220;to thee, sweet poetry, delightful
maid,&#8221; I would consecrate my future days.</p>

<h3>TO PROFESSOR DUGALD STEWART.</h3>

<p>[The iron justice to which the poet alludes, in this letter, was
exercised by Dr. Gregory, on the poem of the &#8220;Wounded Hare.&#8221;]</p>

<p class="sig"><i>Ellisland, 20th Jan, 1789.</i></p>

<p class="sig7"><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>

<p>The enclosed sealed packet I sent to Edinburgh, a few days after I had
the happiness of meeting you in Ayrshire, but you were gone for the
Continent. I have now added a few more of my productions, those for
which I am indebted to the Nithsdale muses. The piece inscribed to R.
G. Esq., is a copy of verses I sent Mr. Graham, of Fintray,
accompanying a request for his assistance in a matter to me of very
great moment. To that gentleman I am already doubly indebted, for
deeds of kindness of serious import to my dearest interests, done in a
manner grateful to the delicate feelings of sensibility. This poem is
a species of composition new to me, but I do not intend it shall be my
last essay of the kind, as you will see by the &#8220;Poet&#8217;s Progress.&#8221;
These fragments, if my design succeed, are but a small part of the
intended whole. I propose it shall be the work of my utmost exertions,
ripened by years; of course I do not wish it much known. The fragment
beginning &#8220;A little, upright, pert, tart, &amp;c.,&#8221; I have not shown to
man living, till I now send it you. It forms the postulata, the
axioms, the definition of a character, which, if it appear at all,
shall be placed in a variety of lights. This particular part I send
you merely as a sample of my hand at portrait-sketching, but, lest
idle conjecture should pretend to point out the original, please to
let it be for your single, sole inspection.</p>

<p>Need I make any apology for this trouble, to a gentleman who has
treated me with such marked benevolence and peculiar kindness&mdash;who has
entered into my interests with so much zeal, and on whose critical
decisions I can so fully depend? A poet as I am by trade, these
decisions are to me of the last consequence. My late transient
acquaintance among some of the mere rank and file of greatness, I
resign with ease; but to the distinguished champions of genius and
learning, I shall be ever ambitious of being known. The native genius
and accurate discernment in Mr. Stewart&#8217;s critical strictures; the
justness (iron justice, for he has no bowels of compassion for a poor
poetic sin<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>ner) of Dr. Gregory&#8217;s remarks, and the delicacy of
Professor Dalzel&#8217;s taste, I shall ever revere.</p>

<p>I shall be in Edinburgh some time next month.</p>

<h3>TO BISHOP GEDDES.</h3>

<p>[Alexander Geddes was a controversialist and poet, and a bishop of the
broken remnant of the Catholic Church of Scotland: he is known as the
author of a very humorous ballad called &#8220;The Wee bit Wifickie,&#8221; and as
the translator of one of the books of the Iliad, in opposition to
Cowper.]</p>

<p class="sig"><i>Ellisland, 3d Feb. 1789.</i></p>

<p class="sig7"><span class="smcap">Venerable Father</span>,</p>

<p>As I am conscious that wherever I am, you do me the honour to interest
yourself in my welfare, it gives me pleasure to inform you that I am
here at last, stationary in the serious business of life, and have now
not only the retired leisure, but the hearty inclination, to attend to
those great and important questions&mdash;what I am? where I am? and for
what I am destined?</p>

<p>In that first concern, the conduct of the man, there was ever but one
side on which I was habitually blameable, and there I have secured
myself in the way pointed out by Nature and Nature&#8217;s God. I was
sensible that to so helpless a creature as a poor poet, a wife and
family were encumbrances, which a species of prudence would bid him
shun; but when the alternative was, being at eternal warfare with
myself, on account of habitual follies, to give them no worse name,
which no general example, no licentious wit, no sophistical
infidelity, would, to me, ever justify, I must have been a fool to
have hesitated, and a madman to have made another choice. Besides, I
had in &#8220;my Jean&#8221; a long and much-loved fellow-creature&#8217;s happiness or
misery among my hands, and who could trifle with such a deposit?</p>

<p>In the affair of a livelihood, I think myself tolerably secure: I have
good hopes of my farm, but should they fail, I have an excise
commission, which on my simple petition, will, at any time, procure me
bread. There is a certain stigma affixed to the character of an Excise
officer, but I do not pretend to borrow honour from my profession; and
though the salary be comparatively small, it is luxury to anything
that the first twenty-five years of my life taught me to expect.</p>

<p>Thus, with a rational aim and method in life, you may easily guess, my
reverend and much-honoured friend, that my characteristical trade is
not forgotten. I am, if possible, more than over an enthusiast to the
muses. I am determined to study man and nature, and in that view
incessantly; and to try if the ripening and corrections of years can
enable me to produce something worth preserving.</p>

<p>You will see in your book, which I beg your pardon for detaining so
long, that I have been tuning my lyre on the banks of Nith. Some large
poetic plans that are floating in my imagination, or partly put in
execution, I shall impart to you when I have the pleasure of meeting
with you; which, if you are then in Edinburgh, I shall have about the
beginning of March.</p>

<p>That acquaintance, worthy Sir, with which you were pleased to honour
me, you must still allow me to challenge; for with whatever unconcern
I give up my transient connexion with the merely great, those
self-important beings whose intrinsic * * * * [con]cealed under the
accidental advantages of their * * * * I cannot lose the patronizing
notice of the learned and good, without the bitterest regret.</p>

<h3>TO MR. JAMES BURNESS.</h3>

<p>[Fanny Burns married Adam Armour, brother to bonnie Jean, went with

<p class="sig"><i>Ellisland, 9th Feb. 1789.</i></p>

<p class="sig7"><span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,</p>

<p>Why I did not write to you long ago, is what, even on the rack, I
could not answer. If you can in your mind form an idea of indolence,
dissipation, hurry, cares, change of country, entering on untried
scenes of life, all combined, you will save me the trouble of a
blushing apology. It could not be want of regard for a man for whom I
had a high esteem before I knew him&mdash;an esteem which has much
increased since I did know him; and this caveat entered, I shall plead
guilty to any other indictment with which you shall please to charge
me.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span></p>

<p>After I had parted from you for many months my life was one continued
scene of dissipation. Here at last I am become stationary, and have
taken a farm and&mdash;a wife.</p>

<p>The farm is beautifully situated on the Nith, a large river that runs
by Dumfries, and falls into the Solway frith. I have gotten a lease of
my farm as long as I pleased: but how it may turn out is just a guess,
it is yet to improve and enclose, &amp;c.; however, I have good hopes of
my bargain on the whole.</p>

<p>My wife is my Jean, with whose story you are partly acquainted. I
found I had a much-loved fellow creature&#8217;s happiness or misery among
my hands, and I durst not trifle with so sacred a deposit. Indeed I
have not any reason to repent the step I have taken, as I have
attached myself to a very good wife, and have shaken myself loose of
every bad failing.</p>

<p>I have found my book a very profitable business, and with the profits
of it I have begun life pretty decently. Should fortune not favour me
in farming, as I have no great faith in her fickle ladyship, I have
provided myself in another resource, which however some folks may
affect to despise it, is still a comfortable shift in the day of
misfortune. In the heyday of my fame, a gentleman whose name at least
I dare say you know, as his estate lies somewhere near Dundee, Mr.
Graham, of Fintray, one of the commissioners of Excise, offered me the
commission of an Excise officer. I thought it prudent to accept the
offer; and accordingly I took my instructions, and have my commission
by me. Whether I may ever do duty, or be a penny the better for it, is
what I do not know; but I have the comfortable assurance, that come
whatever ill fate will, I can, on my simple petition to the
Excise-board, get into employ.</p>

<p>We have lost poor uncle Robert this winter. He has long been very
weak, and with very little alteration on him, he expired 3d Jan.</p>

<p>His son William has been with me this winter, and goes in May to be an
apprentice to a mason. His other son, the eldest, John, comes to me I
expect in summer. They are both remarkably stout young fellows, and
promise to do well. His only daughter, Fanny, has been with me ever
since her father&#8217;s death, and I purpose keeping her in my family till
she be quite woman grown, and fit for service. She is one of the
cleverest girls, and has one of the most amiable dispositions I have
ever seen.</p>

<p>All friends in this country and Ayrshire are well. Remember me to all
friends in the north. My wife joins me in compliments to Mrs. B. and
family.</p>

<p class="sig4">I am ever, my dear Cousin,</p>

<p>Here am I, my honoured friend, returned safe from the capital. To a
man, who has a home, however humble or remote&mdash;if that home is like
mine, the scene of domestic comfort&mdash;the bustle of Edinburgh will soon

<p>When I must skulk into a corner, lest the rattling equipage of some
gaping blockhead should mangle me in the mire, I am tempted to
exclaim&mdash;&#8220;What merits has he had, or what demerit have I had, in some
state of pre-existence, that he is ushered into this state of being
with the sceptre of rule, and the key of riches in his puny fist, and
I am kicked into the world, the sport of folly, or the victim of
pride?&#8221; I have read somewhere of a monarch (in Spain I think it was),
who was so out of humour with the Ptolemean system of astronomy, that
he said had he been of the <span class="smcap">Creator&#8217;s</span> council, he could have
saved him a great deal of labour and absurdity. I will not defend this
blasphemous speech; but often, as I have glided with humble stealth
through the pomp of Princes&#8217; street, it has suggested itself to me, as
an improvement on the present human figure, that a man in proportion
to his own conceit of his consequence in the world, could have pushed
out the longitude of his common size, as a snail pushes out his horns,
or, as we draw out a perspective. This trifling alteration, not to
mention the prodigious saving it would be in the tear and wear of the
neck and limb-sinews of many of his majesty&#8217;s liege subjects, in the
way of tossing the head and tiptoe strutting, would evidently turn out
a vast advantage, in enabling us at once to adjust the ceremonials in
making a bow, or making way to a great man, and that too within a
second of the precise spherical angle of reverence, or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span> an inch of the
particular point of respectful distance, which the important creature
itself requires; as a measuring-glance at its towering altitude, would
determine the affair like instinct.</p>

<p>You are right, Madam, in your idea of poor Mylne&#8217;s poem, which he has
addressed to me. The piece has a good deal of merit, but it has one
great fault&mdash;it is, by far, too long. Besides, my success has
encouraged such a shoal of ill-spawned monsters to crawl into public
notice, under the title of Scottish Poets, that the very term Scottish
Poetry borders on the burlesque. When I write to Mr. Carfrae, I shall
advise him rather to try one of his deceased friend&#8217;s English pieces.
I am prodigiously hurried with my own matters, else I would have
requested a perusal of all Mylne&#8217;s poetic performances; and would have
offered his friends my assistance in either selecting or correcting
what would be proper for the press. What it is that occupies me so
much, and perhaps a little oppresses my present spirits, shall fill up
a paragraph in some future letter. In the mean time, allow me to close
this epistle with a few lines done by a friend of mine * * * * *. I give
you them, that as you have seen the original, you may guess whether
one or two alterations I have ventured to make in them, be any real
improvement.</p>

<h3>TO THE REV. PETER CARFRAE.</h3>

<p>[Mylne was a worthy and a modest man: he died of an inflammatory fever
in the prime of life.]</p>

<p class="sig">1789.</p>

<p class="sig7"><span class="smcap">Rev. Sir</span>,</p>

<p>I do not recollect that I have ever felt a severer pang of shame, than
on looking at the date of your obliging letter which accompanied Mr.
Mylne&#8217;s poem.</p>

<p>I am much to blame: the honour Mr. Mylne has done me, greatly enhanced
in its value by the endearing, though melancholy circumstance, of its
being the last production of his muse, deserved a better return.</p>

<p>I have, as you hint, thought of sending a copy of the poem to some
periodical publication; but, on second thoughts, I am afraid, that in
the present case, it would be an improper step. My success, perhaps as
much accidental as merited, has brought an inundation of nonsense
under the name of Scottish poetry. Subscription-bills for Scottish
poems have so dunned, and daily do dun the public, that the very name
is in danger of contempt. For these reasons, if publishing any of Mr.
Mylne&#8217;s poems in a magazine, &amp;c., be at all prudent, in my opinion it
certainly should not be a Scottish poem. The profits of the labours of
a man of genius are, I hope, as honourable as any profits whatever;
and Mr. Mylne&#8217;s relations are most justly entitled to that honest
harvest, which fate has denied himself to reap. But let the friends of
Mr. Mylne&#8217;s fame (among whom I crave the honour of ranking myself)
always keep in eye his respectability as a man and as a poet, and take
no measure that, before the world knows anything about him, would risk
his name and character being classed with the fools of the times.</p>

<p>I have, Sir, some experience of publishing; and the way in which I
would proceed with Mr. Mylne&#8217;s poem is this:&mdash;I would publish, in two
or three English and Scottish public papers, any one of his English
poems which should, by private judges, be thought the most excellent,
and mention it, at the same time, as one of the productions of a
Lothian farmer, of respectable character, lately deceased, whose poems
his friends had it in idea to publish, soon, by subscription, for the
sake of his numerous family:&mdash;not in pity to that family, but in
justice to what his friends think the poetic merits of the deceased;
and to secure, in the most effectual manner, to those tender
connexions, whose right it is, the pecuniary reward of those merits.</p>

<h3>TO DR. MOORE.</h3>

<p>[Edward Nielson, whom Burns here introduces to Dr. Moore, was minister
of Kirkbean, on the Solway-side.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span> He was a jovial man, and loved good
cheer, and merry company.]</p>

<p class="sig"><i>Ellisland, 23d March, 1789.</i></p>

<p class="sig7"><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>

<p>The gentleman who will deliver you this is a Mr. Nielson, a worthy
clergyman in my neighbourhood, and a very particular acquaintance of
mine. As I have troubled him with this packet, I must turn him over to
your goodness, to recompense him for it in a way in which he much
needs your assistance, and where you can effectually serve him:&mdash;Mr.
Nielson is on his way for France, to wait on his Grace of Queensberry,
on some little business of a good deal of importance to him, and he
wishes for your instructions respecting the most eligible mode of
travelling, &amp;c., for him, when he has crossed the channel. I should
not have dared to take this liberty with you, but that I am told, by
those who have the honour of your personal acquaintance, that to be a
poor honest Scotchman is a letter of recommendation to you, and that
to have it in your power to serve such a character, gives you much
pleasure.</p>

<p>The enclosed ode is a compliment to the memory of the late Mrs.
Oswald, of Auchencruive. You, probably, knew her personally, an honour
of which I cannot boast; but I spent my early years in her
neighbourhood, and among her servants and tenants. I know that she was
detested with the most heart-felt cordiality. However, in the
particular part of her conduct which roused my poetic wrath, she was
much less blameable. In January last, on my road to Ayrshire, I had
put up at Bailie Wigham&#8217;s in Sanquhar, the only tolerable inn in the
place. The frost was keen, and the grim evening and howling wind were
ushering in a night of snow and drift. My horse and I were both much
fatigued with the labours of the day, and just as my friend the Bailie
and I were bidding defiance to the storm, over a smoking bowl, in
wheels the funeral pageantry of the late great Mrs. Oswald, and poor I
am forced to brave all the horrors of the tempestuous night, and jade
my horse, my young favourite horse, whom I had just christened
Pegasus, twelve miles farther on, through the wildest moors and hills
of Ayrshire, to New Cumnock, the next inn. The powers of poesy and
prose sink under me, when I would describe what I felt. Suffice it to
say, that when a good fire at New Cumnock had so far recovered my
frozen sinews, I sat down and wrote the enclosed ode.</p>

<p>I was at Edinburgh lately, and settled finally with Mr. Creech; and I
must own, that, at last, he has been amicable and fair with me.</p>

oppressed by divinity and verse, as they sometimes are.]</p>

<p class="sig"><i>Ellisland, 2d April, 1789.</i></p>

<p>I will make no excuse, my dear Bibliopolus (God forgive me for
murdering language!) that I have sat down to write you on this vile
paper.</p>

<p>It is economy, Sir; it is that cardinal virtue, prudence: so I beg you
will sit down, and either compose or borrow a panegyric. If you are
going to borrow, apply to * * * * to compose, or rather to compound,
something very clever on my remarkable frugality; that I write to one
of my most esteemed friends on this wretched paper, which was
originally intended for the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span> venal fist of some drunken exciseman, to
take dirty notes in a miserable vault of an ale-cellar.</p>

<p>O Frugality! thou mother of ten thousand blessings&mdash;thou cook of fat
beef and dainty greens!&mdash;thou manufacturer of warm Shetland hose, and
comfortable surtouts!&mdash;thou old housewife darning thy decayed
stockings with thy ancient spectacles on thy aged nose!&mdash;lead me, hand
me in thy clutching palsied fist, up those heights, and through those
thickets, hitherto inaccessible, and impervious to my anxious, weary
feet:&mdash;not those Parnassian crags, bleak and barren, where the hungry
worshippers of fame are breathless, clambering, hanging between heaven
and hell; but those glittering cliffs of Potosi, where the
all-sufficient, all powerful deity, Wealth, holds his immediate court
of joys and pleasures; where the sunny exposure of plenty, and the hot
walls of profusion, produce those blissful fruits of luxury, exotics
in this world, and natives of paradise!&mdash;Thou withered sibyl, my sage
conductress, usher me into thy refulgent, adored presence!&mdash;The power,
splendid and potent as he now is, was once the puling nursling of thy
faithful care, and tender arms! Call me thy son, thy cousin, thy
kinsman, or favourite, and adjure the god by the scenes of his infant
years, no longer to repulse me as a stranger, or an alien, but to
favour me with his peculiar countenance and protection?&mdash;He daily
bestows his greatest kindness on the undeserving and the
worthless&mdash;assure him, that I bring ample documents of meritorious
demerits! Pledge yourself for me, that, for the glorious cause of
Lucre, I will do anything, be anything&mdash;but the horse-leech of private
oppression, or the vulture of public robbery!</p>

<p>But to descend from heroics.</p>

<p>I want a Shakspeare; I want likewise an English dictionary&mdash;Johnson&#8217;s,
I suppose, is best. In these and all my prose commissions, the
cheapest is always best for me. There is a small debt of honour that I
owe Mr. Robert Cleghorn, in Saughton Mills, my worthy friend, and your
well-wisher. Please give him, and urge him to take it, the first time
you see him, ten shillings worth of anything you have to sell, and
place it to my account.</p>

<p>The library scheme that I mentioned to you, is already begun, under
the direction of Captain Riddel. There is another in emulation of it
going on at Closeburn, under the auspices of Mr. Monteith, of
Closeburn, which will be on a greater scale than ours. Capt. Riddel
gave his infant society a great many of his old books, else I had
written you on that subject; but one of these days, I shall trouble
you with a commission for &#8220;The Monkland Friendly Society&#8221;&mdash;a copy of
<i>The Spectator</i>, <i>Mirror</i>, and <i>Lounger</i>, <i>Man of Feeling, Man of the
World</i>, <i>Guthrie&#8217;s Geographical Grammar</i>, with some religious pieces,
will likely be our first order.</p>

<p>[Of this accomplished lady, Mrs. M&#8217;Murdo, of Drumlanrig, and her

alluded to was the song of &#8220;Bonnie Jean.&#8221;]</p>

<p class="sig"><i>Ellisland, 2d May, 1789.</i></p>

<p>I have finished the piece which had the happy fortune to be honoured
with your approbation; and never did little miss with more sparkling
pleasure show her applauded sampler to partial mamma, than I now send
my poem to you and Mr. M&#8217;Murdo if he is returned to Drumlanrig. You
cannot easily imagine what thin-skinned animals&mdash;what sensitive plants
poor poets are. How do we shrink into the embittered corner of
self-abasement, when neglected or condemned by those to whom we look
up! and how do we, in erect importance, add another cubit to our
stature on being noticed and applauded by those whom we honour and
respect! My late visit to Drumlanrig has, I can tell you, Madam, given
me a balloon waft up Parnassus, where on my fancied elevation I regard
my poetic self with no small degree of complacency. Surely with all
their sins, the rhyming tribe are not ungrateful creatures.&mdash;I
recollect your goodness to your humble guest&mdash;I see Mr. M&#8217;Murdo adding
to the politeness of the gentleman, the kindness of a friend, and my
heart swells as it would burst, with warm emotions and ardent wishes!
It may be it is not gratitude&mdash;it may be a mixed sensation. That
strange, shifting, doubling animal man is so generally, at best, but a
negative, often a worthless creature, that we cannot see real goodness
and native worth without feeling the bosom glow with sympathetic
approbation.</p>

<p class="sig7"><span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,</p>

<p>Your <i>duty-free</i> favour of the 26th April I received two days ago; I
will not say I perused it with pleasure; that is the cold compliment
of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span> ceremony; I perused it, Sir, with delicious satisfaction;&mdash;in
short, it is such a letter, that not you, nor your friend, but the
legislature, by express proviso in their postage laws, should frank.</p>

<p>A letter informed with the soul of friendship is such an honour to
human nature, that they should order it free ingress and egress to and
from their bags and mails, as an encouragement and mark of distinction
to supereminent virtue.</p>

<p>I have just put the last hand to a little poem which I think will be
something to your taste. One morning lately, as I was out pretty early
in the fields, sowing some grass seeds, I heard the burst of a shot
from a neighbouring plantation, and presently a poor little wounded
hare came crippling by me. You will guess my indignation at the
inhuman fellow who could shoot a hare at this season, when all of them
have young ones. Indeed there is something in that business of
destroying for our sport individuals in the animal creation that do
not injure us materially, which I could never reconcile to my ideas of
virtue.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

However, as in duty bound, I approach my bookseller with an offering

kind of offering from the Rhyming Tribe would be to know them much
less than you do. I do not pretend that there is much merit in these

mostly ill-natured, so are in unison with my present feelings, while
fifty troops of infernal spirits are driving post from ear to ear
along my jaw-bones; and <i>secondly</i>, they are so short, that you cannot
leave off in the middle, and so hurt my pride in the idea that you
found any work of mine too heavy to get through.</p>

you, by all your wishes and by all your hopes, that the muse will
spare the satiric wink in the moment of your foibles; that she will
warble the song of rapture round your hymeneal couch; and that she
will shed on your turf the honest tear of elegiac gratitude! Grant my
request as speedily as possible&mdash;send me by the very first fly or

which I remain, and from inability, I fear, must still remain, your
debtor; but though unable to repay the debt, I assure you, Sir, I
shall ever warmly remember the obligation. It gives me the sincerest
pleasure to hear by my old acquaintance, Mr. Kennedy, that you are, in
immortal Allan&#8217;s language, &#8220;Hale, and weel, and living;&#8221; and that your
charming family are well, and promising to be an amiable and
respectable addition to the company of performers, whom the Great
Manager of the Drama of Man is bringing into action for the succeeding
age.</p>

<p>With respect to my welfare, a subject in which you once warmly and
effectively interested yourself, I am here in my old way, holding my
plough, marking the growth of my corn, or the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span> health of my dairy; and
at times sauntering by the delightful windings of the Nith, on the
margin of which I have built my humble domicile, praying for
seasonable weather, or holding an intrigue with the muses; the only
gipsies with whom I have now any intercourse. As I am entered into the
holy state of matrimony, I trust my face is turned completely
Zion-ward; and as it is a rule with all honest fellows to repeat no
grievances, I hope that the little poetic licenses of former days will
of course fall under the oblivious influence of some good-natured
statute of celestial prescription. In my family devotion, which, like
a good Presbyterian, I occasionally give to my household folks, I am
extremely fond of that psalm, &#8220;Let not the errors of my youth,&#8221; &amp;c.,
and that other, &#8220;Lo, children are God&#8217;s heritage,&#8221; &amp;c., in which last
Mrs. Burns, who by the bye has a glorious &#8220;wood-note wild&#8221; at either
old song or psalmody, joins me with the pathos of Handel&#8217;s Messiah.</p>

<h3>TO MR. ROBERT AINSLIE.</h3>

<p>[The following high-minded letter may be regarded as a sermon on
domestic morality preached by one of the experienced.]</p>

<p class="sig"><i>Ellisland, 8th June, 1789.</i></p>

<p class="sig7"><span class="smcap">My dear Friend,</span></p>

<p>I am perfectly ashamed of myself when I look at the date of your last.
It is not that I forget the friend of my heart and the companion of my
peregrinations; but I have been condemned to drudgery beyond
sufferance, though not, thank God, beyond redemption. I have had a
collection of poems by a lady, put into my hands to prepare them for
the press; which horrid task, with sowing corn with my own hand, a
parcel of masons, wrights, plasterers, &amp;c., to attend to, roaming on
business through Ayrshire&mdash;all this was against me, and the very first
dreadful article was of itself too much for me.</p>

<p>13th. I have not had a moment to spare from incessant toil since the
8th. Life, my dear Sir, is a serious matter. You know by experience
that a man&#8217;s individual self is a good deal, but believe me, a wife
and family of children, whenever you have the honour to be a husband
and a father, will show you that your present and most anxious hours
of solitude are spent on trifles. The welfare of those who are very
dear to us, whose only support, hope and stay we are&mdash;this, to a
generous mind, is another sort of more important object of care than
any concerns whatever which centre merely in the individual. On the
other hand, let no young, unmarried, rakehelly dog among you, make a
song of his pretended liberty and freedom from care. If the relations
we stand in to king, country, kindred, and friends, be anything but
the visionary fancies of dreaming metaphysicians; if religion, virtue,
magnanimity, generosity, humanity and justice, be aught but empty
sounds; then the man who may be said to live only for others, for the
beloved, honourable female, whose tender faithful embrace endears
life, and for the helpless little innocents who are to be the men and
women, the worshippers of his God, the subjects of his king, and the
support, nay the vital existence of his <span class="smcap">country</span> in the
ensuing age;&mdash;compare such a man with any fellow whatever, who,
whether he bustle and push in business among labourers, clerks,
statesmen; or whether he roar and rant, and drink and sing in
taverns&mdash;a fellow over whose grave no one will breathe a single
heigh-ho, except from the cobweb-tie of what is called
good-fellowship&mdash;who has no view nor aim but what terminates in
himself&mdash;if there be any grovelling earth-born wretch of our species, a
renegado to common sense, who would fain believe that the noble
creature man, is no better than a sort of fungus, generated out of
nothing, nobody knows how, and soon dissipated in nothing, nobody
knows where; such a stupid beast, such a crawling reptile, might
balance the foregoing unexaggerated comparison, but no one else would
have the patience.</p>

<p>Forgive me, my dear Sir, for this long silence. <i>To make you amends</i>,
I shall send you soon, and more encouraging still, without any
postage, one or two rhymes of my later manufacture.</p>

<h3>TO MR. M&#8217;MURDO.</h3>

<p>[John M&#8217;Murdo has been already mentioned as one of Burns&#8217;s firmest
friends: his table at Drumlanrig was always spread at the poet&#8217;s
coming: nor was it uncheered by the presence of the lady of the house
and her daughters.]</p>

<p>A poet and a beggar are, in so many points of view, alike, that one
might take them for the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span> same individual character under different
designations; were it not that though, with a trifling poetic license,
most poets may be styled beggars, yet the converse of the proposition
does not hold, that every beggar is a poet. In one particular,
however, they remarkably agree; if you help either the one or the
other to a mug of ale, or the picking of a bone, they will very
willingly repay you with a song. This occurs to me at present, as I
have just despatched a well-lined rib of John Kirkpatrick&#8217;s
Highlander; a bargain for which I am indebted to you, in the style of
our ballad printers, &#8220;Five excellent new songs.&#8221; The enclosed is
nearly my newest song, and one that has cost me some pains, though
that is but an equivocal mark of its excellence. Two or three others,
which I have by me, shall do themselves the honour to wait on your
after leisure: petitioners for admittance into favour must not harass
the condescension of their benefactor.</p>

<p>You see, Sir, what it is to patronize a poet. &#8217;Tis like being a
magistrate in a petty borough; you do them the favour to preside in
their council for one year, and your name bears the prefatory stigma
of Bailie for life.</p>

<p>With, not the compliments, but the best wishes, the sincerest prayers
of the season for you, that you may see many and happy years with Mrs.
M&#8217;Murdo, and your family; two blessings by the bye, to which your rank
does not, by any means, entitle you; a loving wife and fine family
being almost the only good things of this life to which the farm-house
and cottage have an exclusive right,</p>

<h3>TO MRS. DUNLOP.</h3>

<p>[The devil, the pope, and the Pretender darkened the sermons, for more
than a century, of many sound divines in the north. As a Jacobite,
Burns disliked to hear Prince Charles called the Pretender, and as a
man of a tolerant nature, he disliked to hear the Pope treated unlike
a gentleman: his notions regarding Satan are recorded in his
inimitable address.]</p>

<p class="sig"><i>Ellisland, 21st June, 1789.</i></p>

<p class="sig7"><span class="smcap">Dear Madam,</span></p>

<p>Will you take the effusions, the miserable effusions of low spirits,
just as they flow from their bitter spring? I know not of any
particular cause for this worst of all my foes besetting me; but for
some time my soul has been beclouded with a thickening atmosphere of
evil imaginations and gloomy presages.</p>

<p class="sig"><i>Monday Evening.</i></p>

<p>I have just heard Mr. Kirkpatrick preach a sermon. He is a man famous
for his benevolence, and I revere him; but from such ideas of my
Creator, good Lord deliver me! Religion, my honoured friend, is surely
a simple business, as it equally concerns the ignorant and the
learned, the poor and the rich. That there is an incomprehensible
Great Being, to whom I owe my existence, and that he must be
intimately acquainted with the operations and progress of the internal
machinery, and consequent outward deportment of this creature which he
has made; these are, I think, self-evident propositions. That there is
a real and eternal distinction between virtue and vice, and
consequently, that I am an accountable creature; that from the seeming
nature of the human mind, as well as from the evident imperfection,
nay, positive injustice, in the administration of affairs, both in the
natural and moral worlds, there must be a retributive scene of
existence beyond the grave; must, I think, be allowed by every one who
will give himself a moment&#8217;s reflection. I will go farther, and affirm
that from the sublimity, excellence, and purity of his doctrine and
precepts, unparalleled by all the aggregated wisdom and learning of
many preceding ages, though, <i>to appearance</i>, he himself was the
obscurest and most illiterate of our species; therefore Jesus Christ
was from God.</p>

<p>Whatever mitigates the woes, or increases the happiness of others,
this is my criterion of goodness; and whatever injures society at
large, or any individual in it, this is my measure of iniquity.</p>

<p>What think you, madam, of my creed? I trust that I have said nothing
that will lessen me in the eye of one, whose good opinion I value
almost next to the approbation of my own mind.</p>

<h3>TO MR. &mdash;&mdash;.</h3>

<p>[The name of the person to whom the following letter is addressed is
unknown: he seems, from his letter to Burns to have been intimate with
the unfortunate poet,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span> Robert Fergusson, who, in richness of
conversation and plenitude of fancy, reminded him, he said, of Robert
Burns.]</p>

<p class="sig">1789.</p>

<p class="sig7"><span class="smcap">My dear Sir,</span></p>

<p>The hurry of a farmer in this particular season, and the indolence of
a poet at all times and seasons, will, I hope, plead my excuse for
neglecting so long to answer your obliging letter of the 5th of
August.</p>

<p>That you have done well in quitting your laborious concern in * * * *, I
do not doubt; the weighty reasons you mention, were, I hope, very, and
deservedly indeed, weighty ones, and your health is a matter of the
last importance; but whether the remaining proprietors of the paper
have also done well, is what I much doubt. The * * * *, so far as I was a
reader, exhibited such a brilliancy of point, such an elegance of
paragraph, and such a variety of intelligence, that I can hardly
conceive it possible to continue a daily paper in the same degree of
excellence: but if there was a man who had abilities equal to the
task, that man&#8217;s assistance the proprietors have lost.</p>

<p>When I received your letter I was transcribing for * * * *, my letter to
the magistrates of the Canongate, Edinburgh, begging their permission
to place a tombstone over poor Fergusson, and their edict in
consequence of my petition, but now I shall send them to * * * * * *. Poor
Fergusson! If there be a life beyond the grave, which I trust there
is; and if there be a good God presiding over all nature, which I am
sure there is; thou art now enjoying existence in a glorious world,
where worth of the heart alone is distinction in the man; where
riches, deprived of all their pleasure-purchasing powers, return to
their native sordid matter; where titles and honours are the
disregarded reveries of an idle dream; and where that heavy virtue,
which is the negative consequence of steady dulness, and those
thoughtless, though often destructive follies which are unavoidable
aberrations of frail human nature, will be thrown into equal oblivion
as if they had never been!</p>

<p>Adieu my dear sir! So soon as your present views and schemes are
concentered in an aim, I shall be glad to hear from you; as your
welfare and happiness is by no means a subject indifferent to</p>

<p class="sig8">Yours,</p>

<h3>TO MISS WILLIAMS.</h3>

<p>[Helen Maria Williams acknowledged this letter, with the critical
pencilling, on her poem on the Slave Trade, which it enclosed: she
agreed, she said, with all his objections, save one, but considered
his praise too high.]</p>

<p class="sig7"><span class="smcap">Madam</span>,</p>

<p>Of the many problems in the nature of that wonderful creature, man,
this is one of the most extraordinary, that he shall go on from day to
day, from week to week, from month to month, or perhaps from year to
year, suffering a hundred times more in an hour from the impotent
consciousness of neglecting what he ought to do, than the very doing
of it would cost him. I am deeply indebted to you, first for a most
elegant poetic compliment; then for a polite, obliging letter; and,
lastly, for your excellent poem on the Slave Trade; and yet, wretch
that I am! though the debts were debts of honour, and the creditor a
lady, I have put off and put off even the very acknowledgment of the
obligation, until you must indeed be the very angel I take you for, if
you can forgive me.</p>

<p>Your poem I have read with the highest pleasure. I have a way whenever
I read a book, I mean a book in our own trade, Madam, a poetic one,
and when it is my own property, that I take a pencil and mark at the
ends of verses, or note on margins and odd paper, little criticisms of
approbation or disapprobation as I peruse along. I will make no
apology for presenting you with a few unconnected thoughts that
occurred to me in my repeated perusals of your poem. I want to show
you that I have honesty enough to tell you what I take to be truths,
even when they are not quite on the side of approbation; and I do it
in the firm faith that you have equal greatness of mind to hear them
with pleasure.</p>

<p>I had lately the honour of a letter from Dr. Moore, where he tells me
that he has sent me some books: they are not yet come to hand, but I
hear they are on the way.</p>

<p>Wishing you all success in your progress in the path of fame; and that
you may equally escape the danger of stumbling through incautious
speed, or losing ground through loitering neglect.</p>

<p class="sig"><i>Ellisland, near Dumfries, 7th Aug. 1789.</i></p>

<p class="sig7"><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,</p>

<p>I intended to have written you long ere now, and as I told you, I had
gotten three stanzas and a half on my way in a poetic epistle to you;
but that old enemy of all <i>good works</i>, the devil, threw me into a
prosaic mire, and for the soul of me I cannot get out of it. I dare
not write you a long letter, as I am going to intrude on your time
with a long ballad. I have, as you will shortly see, finished &#8220;The
Kirk&#8217;s Alarm;&#8221; but now that it is done, and that I have laughed once
or twice at the conceits in some of the stanzas, I am determined not
to let it get into the public; so I send you this copy, the first that
I have sent to Ayrshire, except some few of the stanzas, which I wrote
off in embryo for Gavin Hamilton, under the express provision and
request that you will only read it to a few of us, and do not on any
account give, or permit to be taken, any copy of the ballad. If I
could be of any service to Dr. M&#8217;Gill, I would do it, though it should
be at a much greater expense than irritating a few bigoted priests,
but I am afraid serving him in his present <i>embarras</i> is a task too
hard for me. I have enemies enow, God knows, though I do not wantonly
add to the number. Still as I think there is some merit in two or
three of the thoughts, I send it to you as a small, but sincere
testimony how much, and with what respectful esteem,</p>

<p>[The poetic epistle of worthy Janet Little was of small account: nor
was the advice of Dr. Moore, to abandon the Scottish stanza and
dialect, and adopt the measure and language of modern English poetry,
better inspired than the strains of the milkmaid, for such was Jenny
Little.]</p>

<p class="sig"><i>Ellisland, 6th Sept., 1789.</i></p>

<p class="sig7"><span class="smcap">Dear Madam</span>,</p>

<p>I have mentioned in my last my appointment to the Excise, and the
birth of little Frank; who, by the bye, I trust will be no discredit
to the honourable name of Wallace, as he has a fine manly countenance,
and a figure that might do credit to a little fellow two months older;
and likewise an excellent good temper, though when he pleases he has a
pipe, only not quite so loud as the horn that his immortal namesake
blew as a signal to take out the pin of Stirling bridge.</p>

<p>I had some time ago an epistle, part poetic, and part prosaic, from
your poetess, Mrs. J. Little, a very ingenious, but modest
composition. I should have written her as she requested, but for the
hurry of this new business. I have heard of her and her compositions
in this country; and I am happy to add, always to the honour of her
character. The fact is, I know not well how to write to her: I should
sit down to a sheet of paper that I knew not how to stain. I am no dab
at fine-drawn letter-writing; and, except when prompted by friendship
or gratitude, or, which happens extremely rarely, inspired by the muse
(I know not her name) that presides over epistolary writing, I sit
down, when necessitated to write, as I would sit down, to beat hemp.</p>

<p>Some parts of your letter of the 20th August, struck me with the most
melancholy concern for the state of your mind at present.</p>

<p>Would I could write you a letter of comfort, I would sit down to it
with as much pleasure, as I would to write an epic poem of my own
composition that should equal the <i>Iliad.</i> Religion, my dear friend,
is the true comfort! A strong persuasion in a future state of
existence; a proposition so obviously probable, that, setting
revelation aside, every nation and people, so far as investigation has
reached, for at least near four thousand years, have, in some mode or
other, firmly believed it. In vain would we reason and pretend to
doubt. I have myself done so to a very daring pitch; but, when I
reflected, that I was opposing the most ardent wishes, and the most
darling hopes of good men, and flying in the face of all human belief,
in all ages, I was shocked at my own conduct.</p>

<p>I know not whether I have ever sent you the following lines, or if you
have ever seen them; but it is one of my favourite quotations, which I
keep constantly by me in my progress through life, in the language of
the book of Job,</p>

<h3>TO MR. ROBERT AINSLIE.</h3>

<p>[The ignominy of a poet becoming a gauger seems ever to have been
present to the mind of Burns&mdash;but those moving things ca&#8217;d wives and
weans have a strong influence on the actions of man.]</p>

<p class="sig"><i>Ellisland, 1st Nov. 1789.</i></p>

<p class="sig7"><span class="smcap">My dear Friend,</span></p>

<p>I had written you long ere now, could I have guessed where to find
you, for I am sure you have more good sense than to waste the precious
days of vacation time in the dirt of business and Edinburgh.&mdash;Wherever
you are, God bless you, and lead you not into temptation, but deliver
you from evil!</p>

<p>I do not know if I have informed you that I am now appointed to an
excise division, in the middle of which my house and farm lie. In this
I was extremely lucky. Without ever having been an expectant, as they
call their journeymen excisemen, I was directly planted down to all
intents and purposes an officer of excise; there to flourish and bring
forth fruits&mdash;worthy of repentance.</p>

<p>I know not how the word exciseman, or still more opprobrious, gauger,
will sound in your ears. I too have seen the day when my auditory
nerves would have felt very delicately on this subject; but a wife and
children are things which have a wonderful power in blunting these
kind of sensations. Fifty pounds a year for life, and a provision for
widows and orphans, you will allow is no bad settlement for a <i>poet.</i>
For the ignominy of the profession, I have the encouragement which I
once heard a recruiting sergeant give to a numerous, if not a
respectable audience, in the streets of Kilmarnock.&mdash;&#8220;Gentlemen, for
your further and better encouragement, I can assure you that our
regiment is the most blackguard corps under the crown, and
consequently with us an honest fellow has the surest chance for
preferment.&#8221;</p>

<p>You need not doubt that I find several very unpleasant and
disagreeable circumstances in my business; but I am tired with and
disgusted at the language of complaint against the evils of life.
Human existence in the most favourable situations does not abound with
pleasures, and has its inconveniences and ills; capricious foolish man
mistakes these inconveniences and ills as if they were the peculiar
property of his particular situation; and hence that eternal
fickleness, that love of change, which has ruined, and daily does ruin
many a fine fellow, as well as many a blockhead, and is almost,
without exception, a constant source of disappointment and misery.</p>

<p>I long to hear from you how you go on&mdash;not so much in business as in
life. Are you pretty well satisfied with your own exertions, and
tolerably at ease in your internal reflections? &#8217;Tis much to be a
great character as a lawyer, but beyond comparison more to be a great
character as a man. That you may be both the one and the other is the
earnest wish, and that you <i>will</i> be both is the firm persuasion of,</p>

<h3>TO MR. RICHARD BROWN.</h3>

<p>[With this letter closes the correspondence of Robert Burns and
Richard Brown.]</p>

<p class="sig"><i>Ellisland, 4th November, 1789.</i></p>

<p>I have been so hurried, my ever dear friend, that though I got both
your letters, I have not been able to command an hour to answer them
as I wished; and even now, you are to look on this as merely
confessing debt, and craving days. Few things could have given me so
much pleasure as the news that you were once more safe and sound on
terra firma, and happy in that place where happiness is alone to be
found, in the fireside circle. May the benevolent Director of all
things peculiarly bless you in all those endearing connexions
consequent on the tender and venerable names of husband and father! I
have indeed been extremely lucky in getting an additional income of
&pound;50 a year, while, at the same time, the appointment will not cost me
above &pound;10 or &pound;12 per annum of expenses more than I must have
inevitably incurred. The worst circumstance is, that the excise
division which I have got is so extensive, no less than ten parishes
to ride over; and it abounds besides with so much business, that I can
scarcely steal a spare moment. However, labour endears rest, and both
together are absolutely necessary for the proper enjoyment of human
existence. I cannot meet you anywhere. No less than an order from the
Board of Excise, at Edinburgh, is necessary before I can have so much
time as to meet you in Ayrshire. But do you come, and see me. We must
have a social<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span> day, and perhaps lengthen it out with half the half the
night before you go again to sea. You are the earliest friend I now
have on earth, my brothers excepted; and is not that an endearing
circumstance? When you and I first met, we were at the green period of
human life. The twig would easily take a bent, but would as easily
return to its former state. You and I not only took a mutual bent, but
by the melancholy, though strong influence of being both of the family
of the unfortunate, we were entwined with one another in our growth
towards advanced age; and blasted be the sacrilegious hand that shall
attempt to undo the union! You and I must have one bumper to my
favourite toast, &#8220;May the companions of our youth be the friends of
our old age!&#8221; Come and see me one year; I shall see you at Port
Glasgow the next, and if we can contrive to have a gossiping between
our two bedfellows, it will be so much additional pleasure. Mrs.
Burns joins me in kind compliments to you and Mrs. Brown. Adieu!</p>

<h3>TO R. GRAHAM, ESQ.</h3>

<p>[The poet enclosed in this letter to his patron in the Excise the
clever verses on Captain Grose, the Kirk&#8217;s Alarm, and the first ballad
on Captain Miller&#8217;s election.]</p>

<p class="sig"><i>9th December, 1789.</i></p>

<p class="sig7"><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>

<p>I have a good while had a wish to trouble you with a letter, and had
certainly done it long ere now&mdash;but for a humiliating something that
throws cold water on the resolution, as if one should say, &#8220;You have
found Mr. Graham a very powerful and kind friend indeed, and that
interest he is so kindly taking in your concerns, you ought by
everything in your power to keep alive and cherish.&#8221; Now though since
God has thought proper to make one powerful and another helpless, the
connexion of obliger and obliged is all fair; and though my being
under your patronage is to me highly honourable, yet, Sir, allow me to
flatter myself, that, as a poet and an honest man you first interested
yourself in my welfare, and principally as such, still you permit me
to approach you.</p>

<p>I have found the excise business go on a great deal smoother with me
than I expected; owing a good deal to the generous friendship of Mr.
Mitchel, my collector, and the kind assistance of Mr. Findlater, my
supervisor. I dare to be honest, and I fear no labour. Nor do I find
my hurried life greatly inimical to my correspondence with the muses.
Their visits to me, indeed, and I believe to most of their
acquaintance, like the visits of good angels, are short and far
between: but I meet them now and then as I jog through the hills of
Nithsdale, just as I used to do on the banks of Ayr. I take the
liberty to enclose you a few bagatelles, all of them the productions
of my leisure thoughts in my excise rides.</p>

<p>If you know or have ever seen Captain Grose, the antiquarian, you will
enter into any humour that is in the verses on him. Perhaps you have
seen them before, as I sent them to a London newspaper. Though I dare
say you have none of the solemn-league-and-covenant fire, which shone
so conspicuous in Lord George Gordon, and the Kilmarnock weavers, yet
I think you must have heard of Dr. M&#8217;Gill, one of the clergymen of
Ayr, and his heretical book. God help him, poor man! Though he is one
of the worthiest, as well as one of the ablest of the whole priesthood
of the Kirk of Scotland, in every sense of that ambiguous term, yet
the poor Doctor and his numerous family are in imminent danger of
being thrown out to the mercy of the winter-winds. The enclosed ballad
on that business is, I confess, too local, but I laughed myself at
some conceits in it, though I am convinced in my conscience that there
are a good many heavy stanzas in it too.</p>

<p>The election ballad, as you will see, alludes to the present canvass
in our string of boroughs. I do not believe there will be such a
hard-run match in the whole general election.</p>

<p>I am too little a man to have any political attachments; I am deeply
indebted to, and have the warmest veneration for, individuals of both
parties; but a man who has it in his power to be the father of his
country, and who * * * * *, is a character that one cannot speak of
with patience.</p>

<p>Sir J. J. does &#8220;what man can do,&#8221; but yet I doubt his fate.</p>

<h3>TO MRS. DUNLOP.</h3>

<p>[Burns was often a prey to lowness of spirits: at this some dull men
have marvelled; but the dull have no misgivings: they go blindly and
stupidly on, like a horse in a mill, and have none of the sorrows or
joys which genius is heir to.]</p>

<p class="sig"><i>Ellisland, 13th December, 1789.</i></p>

<p>Many thanks, dear Madam, for your sheet-full of rhymes. Though at
present I am below the veriest prose, yet from you everything pleases.
I am groaning under the miseries of a diseased nervous system; a
system, the state of which is most conducive to our happiness&mdash;or the
most productive of our misery. For now near three weeks I have been so
ill with a nervous head-ache, that I have been obliged for a time to
give up my excise-books, being scarce able to lift my head, much less
to ride once a week over ten muir parishes. What is man?&mdash;To-day in
the luxuriance of health, exulting in the enjoyment of existence; in a
few days, perhaps in a few hours, loaded with conscious painful being,
counting the tardy pace of the lingering moments by the repercussions
of anguish, and refusing or denied a comforter. Day follows night, and
night comes after day, only to curse him with life which gives him no
pleasure; and yet the awful, dark termination of that life is
something at which he recoils.</p>

<p>Can it be possible, that when I resign this frail, feverish being, I
shall still find myself in conscious existence? When the last gasp of
agony has announced that I am no more to those that knew me, and the
few who loved me; when the cold, stiffened, unconscious, ghastly corse
is resigned into the earth, to be the prey of unsightly reptiles, and
to become in time a trodden clod, shall I be yet warm in life, seeing
and seen, enjoying and enjoyed? Ye venerable sages and holy flamens,
is there probability in your conjectures, truth in your stories, of
another world beyond death; or are they all alike, baseless visions,
and fabricated fables? If there is another life, it must be only for
the just, the benevolent, the amiable, and the humane; what a
flattering idea, then, is a world to come! Would to God I as firmly
believed it, as I ardently wish it! There I should meet an aged
parent, now at rest from the many buffetings of an evil world, against
which he so long and so bravely struggled. There should I meet the
friend, the disinterested friend of my early life; the man who
rejoiced to see me, because he loved me and could serve me.&mdash;Muir, thy
weaknesses were the aberrations of human nature, but thy heart glowed
with everything generous, manly and noble; and if ever emanation from
the All-good Being animated a human form, it was thine! There should
I, with speechless agony of rapture, again recognise my lost, my ever
dear Mary! whose bosom was fraught with truth, honour, constancy, and
love.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;My Mary, dear departed shade!<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>Jesus Christ, thou amiablest of characters! I trust thou art no
impostor, and that thy revelation of blissful scenes of existence
beyond death and the grave, is not one of the many impositions which
time after time have been palmed on credulous mankind. I trust that in
thee &#8220;shall all the families of the earth be blessed,&#8221; by being yet
connected together in a better world, where every tie that bound heart
to heart, in this state of existence, shall be, far beyond our present
conceptions, more endearing.</p>

<p>I am a good deal inclined to think with those who maintain, that what
are called nervous affections are in fact diseases of the mind. I
cannot reason, I cannot think; and but to you I would not venture to
write anything above an order to a cobbler. You have felt too much of
the ills of life not to sympathise with a diseased wretch, who has
impaired more than half of any faculties he possessed. Your goodness
will excuse this distracted scrawl, which the writer dare scarcely
read, and which he would throw into the fire, were he able to write
anything better, or indeed anything at all.</p>

<p>Rumour told me something of a son of yours, who was returned from the
East or West Indies. If you have gotten news from James or Anthony, it
was cruel in you not to let me know; as I promise you on the sincerity
of a man, who is weary of one world, and anxious about another, that
scarce anything could give me so much pleasure as to hear of any good
thing befalling my honoured friend.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span></p>

<p>In vain have I from day to day expected to hear from Mrs. Young, as
she promised me at Dalswinton that she would do me the honour to
introduce me at Tinwald; and it was impossible, not from your
ladyship&#8217;s accessibility, but from my own feelings, that I could go
alone. Lately indeed, Mr. Maxwell of Carruchen, in his usual goodness,
offered to accompany me, when an unlucky indisposition on my part
hindered my embracing the opportunity. To court the notice or the
tables of the great, except where I sometimes have had a little matter
to ask of them, or more often the pleasanter task of witnessing my
gratitude to them, is what I never have done, and I trust never shall
do. But with your ladyship I have the honour to be connected by one of
the strongest and most endearing ties in the whole moral world. Common
sufferers, in a cause where even to be unfortunate is glorious, the
cause of heroic loyalty! Though my fathers had not illustrious honours
and vast properties to hazard in the contest, though they left their
humble cottages only to add so many units more to the unnoted crowd
that followed their leaders, yet what they could they did, and what
they had they lost; with unshaken firmness and unconcealed political
attachments, they shook hands with ruin for what they esteemed the
cause of their king and their country. The language and the enclosed
verses are for your ladyship&#8217;s eye alone. Poets are not very famous
for their prudence; but as I can do nothing for a cause which is now
nearly no more, I do not wish to hurt myself.</p>

<p class="sig7"><span class="smcap">Dear Provost</span>,</p>

<p>As my friend Mr. Graham goes for your good town to-morrow, I cannot
resist the temptation to send you a few lines, and as I have nothing
to say I have chosen this sheet of foolscap, and begun as you see at
the top of the first page, because I have ever observed, that when
once people have fairly set out they know not where to stop. Now that
my first sentence is concluded, I have nothing to do but to pray
heaven to help me on to another. Shall I write you on Politics or
Religion, two master subjects for your sayers of nothing. Of the first
I dare say by this time you are nearly surfeited: and for the last,
whatever they may talk of it, who make it a kind of company concern, I
never could endure it beyond a soliloquy. I might write you on
farming, on building, or marketing, but my poor distracted mind is so
torn, so jaded, so racked and bediveled with the task of the
superlative damned to make <i>one guinea do the business of three</i>, that
I detest, abhor, and swoon at the very word business, though no less
than four letters of my very short sirname are in it.</p>

<p>Well, to make the matter short, I shall betake myself to a subject
ever fruitful of themes; a subject the turtle-feast of the sons of
Satan, and the delicious secret sugar-plum of the babes of grace&mdash;a
subject sparkling with all the jewels that wit can find in the mines
of genius: and pregnant with all the stores of learning from Moses and
Confucius to Franklin and Priestley&mdash;in short, may it please your
Lordship, I intend to write * * *</p>

<p>[<i>Here the Poet inserted a song which can only be sung at times when
the punch-bowl has done its duty and wild wit is set free.</i>]</p>

<p>If at any time you expect a field-day in your town, a day when Dukes,
Earls, and Knights pay their court to weavers, tailors, and cobblers,
I should like to know of it two or three days beforehand. It is not
that I care three skips of a cur dog for the politics, but I should
like to see<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span> such an exhibition of human nature. If you meet with that

compliments.</p>

<h3>TO SIR JOHN SINCLAIR.</h3>

<p>[Of the Monkland Book-Club alluded to in this letter, the clergyman
had omitted all mention in his account of the Parish of Dunscore,
published in Sir John Sinclair&#8217;s work: some of the books which the
poet introduced were stigmatized as vain and frivolous.]</p>

<p class="sig">1790.</p>

<p class="sig7"><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>

<p>The following circumstance has, I believe, been committed in the
statistical account, transmitted to you of the parish of Dunscore, in
Nithsdale. I beg leave to send it to you because it is new, and may be
useful. How far it is deserving of a place in your patriotic
publication, you are the best judge.</p>

<p>To store the minds of the lower classes with useful knowledge, is
certainly of very great importance, both to them as individuals and to
society at large. Giving them a turn for reading and reflection, is
giving them a source of innocent and laudable amusement: and besides,
raises them to a more dignified degree in the scale of rationality.
Impressed with this idea, a gentleman in this parish, Robert Riddel,
Esq., of Glenriddel, set on foot a species of circulating library, on
a plan so simple as to be practicable in any corner of the country;
and so useful, as to deserve the notice of every country gentleman,
who thinks the improvement of that part of his own species, whom
chance has thrown into the humble walks of the peasant and the
artisan, a matter worthy of his attention.</p>

<p>Mr. Riddel got a number of his own tenants, and farming neighbors, to
form themselves into a society for the purpose of having a library
among themselves. They entered into a legal engagement to abide by it
for three years; with a saving clause or two in case of a removal to a
distance, or death. Each member, at his entry, paid five shillings;
and at each of their meetings, which were held every fourth Saturday,
sixpence more. With their entry-money, and the credit which they took
on the faith of their future funds, they laid in a tolerable stock of
books at the commencement. What authors they were to purchase, was
always decided by the majority. At every meeting, all the books, under
certain fines and forfeitures, by way of penalty, were to be produced;
and the members had their choice of the volumes in rotation. He whose
name stood for that night first on the list, had his choice of what
volume he pleased in the whole collection; the second had his choice
after the first; the third after the second, and so on to the last. At
next meeting, he who had been first on the list at the preceding
meeting, was last at this; he who had been second was first; and so on
through the whole three years. At the expiration of the engagement the
books were sold by auction, but only among the members themselves;
each man had his share of the common stock, in money or in books, as
he chose to be a purchaser or not.</p>

<p>At the breaking up of this little society, which was formed under Mr.
Riddel&#8217;s patronage, what with benefactions of books from him, and what
with their own purchases, they had collected together upwards of one
hundred and fifty volumes. It will easily be guessed, that a good deal
of trash would be bought. Among the books, however, of this little
library, were, <i>Blair&#8217;s Sermons</i>, <i>Robertson&#8217;s History of Scotland</i>,
<i>Hume&#8217;s History of the Stewarts</i>, <i>The Spectator</i>, <i>Idler</i>,
<i>Adventurer</i>, <i>Mirror</i>, <i>Lounger</i>, <i>Observer</i>, <i>Man of Feeling</i>, <i>Man
of the World</i>, <i>Chrysal</i>, <i>Don Quixote</i>, <i>Joseph Andrews</i>, &amp;c. A
peasant who can read, and enjoy such books, is certainly a much
superior being to his neighbour, who perhaps stalks besides his team,
very little removed, except in shape, from the brutes he drives.</p>

<p>Wishing your patriotic exertions their so much merited success,</p>

<p class="sig4">I am, Sir,</p>

<h3>TO CHARLES SHARPE, ESQ.,</h3>

<h4>OF HODDAM.</h4>

<p>[The family of Hoddam is of old standing in Nithsdale. It has mingled
blood with some of the noblest Scottish names; nor is it unknown
either in history or literature&mdash;the fierce knight of Closeburn, who
in the scuffle between Bruce and Comyne drew his sword and made<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[417]</a></span>
&#8220;sicker,&#8221; and my friend Charles Kirkpatrick Sharpe, are not the least
distinguished of its members.]</p>

<p class="sig">[1790.]</p>

<p>It is true, Sir, you are a gentleman of rank and fortune, and I am a
poor devil: you are a feather in the cap of society, and I am a very
hobnail in its shoes; yet I have the honour to belong to the same
family with you, and on that score I now address you. You will perhaps
suspect that I am going to claim affinity with the ancient and
honourable house of Kirkpatrick. No, no, Sir: I cannot indeed be
properly said to belong to any house, or even any province or kingdom;
as my mother, who, for many years was spouse to a marching regiment,
gave me into this bad world, aboard the packet-boat, somewhere between
Donaghadee and Portpatrick. By our common family, I mean, Sir, the
family of the muses. I am a fiddler and a poet; and you, I am told,
play an exquisite violin, and have a standard taste in the Belles
Lettres. The other day, a brother catgut gave me a charming Scots air
of your composition. If I was pleased with the tune, I was in raptures
with the title you have given it; and taking up the idea I have spun
it into the three stanzas enclosed. Will you allow me, Sir, to present
you them, as the dearest offering that a misbegotten son of poverty
and rhyme has to give? I have a longing to take you by the hand and
unburthen my heart by saying, &#8220;Sir, I honour you as a man who supports
the dignity of human nature, amid an age when frivolity and avarice
have, between them, debased us below the brutes that perish!&#8221; But,
alas, Sir! to me you are unapproachable. It is true, the muses
baptized me in Castalian streams, but the thoughtless gipsies forgot
to give me a name. As the sex have served many a good fellow, the Nine
have given me a great deal of pleasure, but, bewitching jades! they
have beggared me. Would they but spare me a little of their
cast-linen! Were it only in my power to say that I have a shirt on my
back! but the idle wenches, like Solomon&#8217;s lilies, &#8220;they toil not,
neither do they spin;&#8221; so I must e&#8217;en continue to tie my remnant of a
cravat, like the hangman&#8217;s rope, round my naked throat, and coax my
galligaskins to keep together their many-coloured fragments. As to the
affair of shoes, I have given that up. My pilgrimages in my
ballad-trade, from town to town, and on your stony-hearted turnpikes
too, are what not even the hide of Job&#8217;s Behemoth could bear. The coat
on my back is no more: I shall not speak evil of the dead. It would be
equally unhandsome and ungrateful to find fault with my old surtout,
which so kindly supplies and conceals the want of that coat. My hat
indeed is a great favourite; and though I got it literally for an old
song, I would not exchange it for the best beaver in Britain. I was,
during several years, a kind of factotum servant to a country
clergyman, where I pickt up a good many scraps of learning,
particularly in some branches of the mathematics. Whenever I feel
inclined to rest myself on my way, I take my seat under a hedge,
laying my poetic wallet on the one side, and my fiddle-case on the
other, and placing my hat between my legs, I can, by means of its
brim, or rather brims, go through the whole doctrine of the conic
sections.</p>

<p>However, Sir, don&#8217;t let me mislead you, as if I would interest your
pity. Fortune has so much forsaken me, that she has taught me to live
without her; and amid all my rags and poverty, I am as independent,
and much more happy, than a monarch of the world. According to the
hackneyed metaphor, I value the several actors in the great drama of
life, simply as they act their parts. I can look on a worthless fellow
of a duke with unqualified contempt, and can regard an honest
scavenger with sincere respect. As you, Sir, go through your role with
such distinguished merit, permit me to make one in the chorus of
universal applause, and assure you that with the highest respect,</p>

<p class="sig7"><span class="smcap">Dear Brother</span>,</p>

<p>I mean to take advantage of the frank, though I have not, in my
present frame of mind, much appetite for exertion in writing. My
nerves are in a cursed state. I feel that horrid hypochondria
pervading every atom of both body and soul. This farm has undone my
enjoyment of myself. It is a ruinous affair on all hands<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span> But let it
go to bell! I&#8217;ll fight it out and be off with it.</p>

<p>We have gotten a set of very decent players here just now. I have seen
them an evening or two. David Campbell, in Ayr, wrote to me by the
manager of the company, a Mr. Sutherland, who is a man of apparent

<h3>TO WILLIAM DUNBAR, W.S.</h3>

<p>[This letter was first published by the Ettrick Shepherd, in his
edition of Burns: it is remarkable for this sentence, &#8220;I am resolved
never to breed up a son of mine to any of the learned professions: I
know the value of independence, and since I cannot give my sons an
independent fortune, I shall give them an independent line of life.&#8221;
We may look round us and inquire which line of life the poet could
possibly mean.]</p>

<p class="sig"><i>Ellisland, 14th January, 1790.</i></p>

<p>Since we are here creatures of a day, since &#8220;a few summer days, and a
few winter nights, and the life of man is at an end,&#8221; why, my dear
much-esteem Sir, should you and I let negligent indolence, for I know
it is nothing worse, step in between us and bar the enjoyment of a
mutual correspondence? We are not shapen out of the common, heavy,
methodical clod, the elemental stuff of the plodding selfish race, the
sons of Arithmetic and Prudence; our feelings and hearts are not
benumbed and poisoned by the cursed influence of riches, which,
whatever blessing they may be in other respects, are no friends to the
nobler qualities of the heart: in the name of random sensibility,
then, let never the moon change on our silence any more. I have had a
tract of had health most part of this winter, else you had heard from
me long ere now. Thank Heaven, I am now got so much better as to be
able to partake a little in the enjoyments of life.</p>

<p>Our friend Cunningham will, perhaps, have told you of my going into
the Excise. The truth is, I found it a very convenient business to
have &pound;50 per annum, nor have I yet felt any of those mortifying
circumstances in it that I was led to fear.</p>

<p class="sig"><i>Feb. 2.</i></p>

<p>I have not, for sheer hurry of business, been able to spare five
minutes to finish my letter. Besides my farm business, I ride on my
Excise matters at least two hundred miles every week. I have not by
any means given up the muses. You will see in the 3d vol. of Johnson&#8217;s
Scots songs that I have contributed my mite there.</p>

<p>But, my dear Sir, little ones that look up to you for paternal
protection are an important charge. I have already two fine, healthy,
stout little fellows, and I wish to throw some light upon them. I have
a thousand reveries and schemes about them, and their future destiny.
Not that I am a Utopian projector in these things. I am resolved never
to breed up a son of mine to any of the learned professions. I know
the value of independence; and since I cannot give my sons an
independent fortune, I shall give them an independent line of life.
What a chaos of hurry, chance, and changes is this world, when one
sits soberly down to reflect on it! To a father, who himself knows the
world, the thought that he shall have sons to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span> usher into it must fill
him with dread; but if he have daughters, the prospect in a thoughtful
moment is apt to shock him.</p>

<p>I hope Mrs. Fordyce and the two young ladies are well. Do let me
forget that they are nieces of yours, and let me say that I never saw
a more interesting, sweeter pair of sisters in my life. I am the fool
of my feelings and attachments. I often take up a volume of my Spenser
to realize you to my imagination, and think over the social scenes we
have had together. God grant that there may be another world more
congenial to honest fellows beyond this. A world where these rubs and
plagues of absence, distance, misfortunes, ill-health, &amp;c., shall no
more damp hilarity and divide friendship. This I know is your throng
season, but half a page will much oblige,</p>

<h3>TO MRS. DUNLOP.</h3>

<p>[Falconer, the poet, whom Burns mentions here, perished in the Aurora,
in which he acted as purser: he was a satirist of no mean power, and
wrote that useful work, the Marine Dictionary: but his fame depends
upon &#8220;The Shipwreck,&#8221; one of the most original and mournful poems in
the language.]</p>

<p class="sig"><i>Ellisland, 25th January, 1790.</i></p>

<p>It has been owing to unremitting hurry of business that I have not
written to you, Madam, long ere now. My health is greatly better, and
I now begin once more to share in satisfaction and enjoyment with the
rest of my fellow-creatures.</p>

<p>Many thanks, my much-esteemed friend, for your kind letters; but why
will you make me run the risk of being contemptible and mercenary in
my own eyes? When I pique myself on my independent spirit, I hope it
is neither poetic license, nor poetic rant; and I am so flattered with
the honour you have done me, in making me your compeer in friendship
and friendly correspondence, that I cannot without pain, and a degree
of mortification, be reminded of the real inequality between our
situations.</p>

<p>Most sincerely do I rejoice with you, dear Madam, in the good news of
Anthony. Not only your anxiety about his fate, but my own esteem for
such a noble, warm-hearted, manly young fellow, in the little I had of
his acquaintance, has interested me deeply in his fortunes.</p>

<p>Falconer, the unfortunate author of the &#8220;Shipwreck,&#8221; which you so much
admire, is no more. After witnessing the dreadful catastrophe he so
feelingly describes in his poem, and after weathering many hard gales
of fortune, he went to the bottom with the Aurora frigate!</p>

<p>I forget what part of Scotland had the honour of giving him birth; but
he was the son of obscurity and misfortune. He was one of those daring
adventurous spirits, which Scotland, beyond any other country, is
remarkable for producing. Little does the fond mother think, as she
hangs delighted over the sweet little leech at her bosom, where the
poor fellow may hereafter wander, and what may be his fate. I remember
a stanza in an old Scottish ballad, which, notwithstanding its rude
simplicity, speaks feelingly to the heart:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;Little did my mother think,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That day she cradled me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What land I was to travel in,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Or what death I should die!&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Old Scottish song are, you know, a favourite study and pursuit of
mine, and now I am on that subject, allow me to give you two stanzas
of another old simple ballad, which I am sure will please you. The
catastrophe of the piece is a poor ruined female, lamenting her fate.
She concludes with this pathetic wish:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;O that my father had ne&#8217;er on me smil&#8217;d;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">O that my mother had ne&#8217;er to me sung!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O that my cradle had never been rock&#8217;d;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But that I had died when I was young!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;O that the grave it were my bed;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">My blankets were my winding sheet;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The clocks and the worms my bedfellows a&#8217;;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And O sae sound as I should sleep!&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>I do not remember in all my reading, to have met with anything more
truly the language of misery, than the exclamation in the last line.
Misery is like love; to speak its language truly, the author must have
felt it.</p>

<p>I am every day expecting the doctor to give your little godson<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> the
small-pox. They are <i>rife</i> in the country, and I tremble for his fate.
By the way, I cannot help congratulating you on his looks and spirit.
Every person who sees <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span>
him, acknowledges him to be the finest, handsomest child he has ever
seen. I am myself delighted with the manly swell of his little chest,
and a certain miniature dignity in the carriage of his head, and the
glance of his fine black eye, which promise the undaunted gallantry of
an independent mind.</p>

<p>I thought to have sent you some rhymes, but time forbids. I promise
you poetry until you are tired of it, next time I have the honour of
assuring you how truly I am, &amp;c.</p>

<h3>TO MR. PETER HILL,</h3>

<h4>BOOKSELLER, EDINBURGH.</h4>

<p>[The Mademoiselle Burns whom the poet inquires about, was one of the
&#8220;ladies of the Canongate,&#8221; who desired to introduce free trade in her
profession into a close borough: this was refused by the magistrates
of Edinburgh, though advocated with much eloquence and humour in a
letter by her namesake&mdash;it is coloured too strongly with her calling
to be published.]</p>

<p class="sig"><i>Ellisland, 2d Feb., 1790.</i></p>

<p>No! I will not say one word about apologies or excuses for not
writing.&mdash;I am a poor, rascally gauger, condemned to gallop at least
200 miles every week to inspect dirty ponds and yeasty barrels, and
where can I find time to write to, or importance to interest anybody?
The upbraidings of my conscience, nay the upbraidings of my wife, have
persecuted me on your account these two or three months past.&mdash;I wish
to God I was a great man, that my correspondence might throw light
upon you, to let the world see what you really are: and then I would
make your fortune without putting my hand in my pocket for you, which,
like all other great men, I suppose I would avoid as much as possible.
What are you doing, and how are you doing? Have you lately seen any of
my few friends? What is become of the <span class="smcap">borough reform</span>, or how
is the fate of my poor namesake, Mademoiselle Burns, decided? O man!
but for thee and thy selfish appetites, and dishonest artifices, that
beauteous form, and that once innocent and still ingenuous mind, might
have shone conspicuous and lovely in the faithful wife, and the
affectionate mother; and shall the unfortunate sacrifice to thy
pleasures have no claim on thy humanity!</p>

<p>I saw lately in a Review, some extracts from a new poem, called the
Village Curate; send it me. I want likewise a cheap copy of The World.
Mr. Armstrong, the young poet, who does me the honour to mention me so
kindly in his works, please give him my best thanks for the copy of
his book&mdash;I shall write him, my first leisure hour. I like his poetry
much, but I think his style in prose quite astonishing.</p>

<p>Your book came safe, and I am going to trouble you with further
commissions. I call it troubling you,&mdash;because I want only,
<span class="smcap">books</span>; the cheapest way, the best; so you may have to hunt
for them in the evening auctions. I want Smollette&#8217;s works, for the
sake of his incomparable humour. I have already Roderick Random, and
Humphrey Clinker.&mdash;Peregrine Pickle, Launcelot Greaves, and Ferdinand
Count Fathom, I still want; but as I said, the veriest ordinary copies
will serve me. I am nice only in the appearance of my poets. I forget
the price of Cowper&#8217;s Poems, but, I believe, I must have them. I saw
the other day, proposals for a publication, entitled &#8220;Banks&#8217;s new and
complete Christian&#8217;s Family Bible,&#8221; printed for C. Cooke,
Paternoster-row, London.&mdash;He promises at least, to give in the work, I
think it is three hundred and odd engravings, to which he has put the
names of the first artists in London.&mdash;You will know the character of
the performance, as some numbers of it are published; and if it is
really what it pretends to be, set me down as a subscriber, and send
me the published numbers.</p>

<p>Let me hear from you, your first leisure minute, and trust me you
shall in future have no reason to complain of my silence. The dazzling
perplexity of novelty will dissipate and leave me to pursue my course
in the quiet path of methodical routine.</p>

<p>[The poet has recorded this unlooked-for death of the Dominie&#8217;s mare
in some hasty verses, which are not much superior to the subject.]</p>

<p class="sig"><i>Ellisland, Feb. 9th, 1790.</i></p>

<p class="sig7"><span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,</p>

<p>That d&mdash;mned mare of yours is dead. I would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[421]</a></span> freely have given her
price to have saved her; she has vexed me beyond description. Indebted
as I was to your goodness beyond what I can ever repay, I eagerly
grasped at your offer to have the mare with me. That I might at least
show my readiness in wishing to be grateful, I took every care of her
in my power. She was never crossed for riding above half a score of
times by me or in my keeping. I drew her in the plough, one of three,
for one poor week. I refused fifty-five shillings for her, which was
the highest bode I could squeeze for her. I fed her up and had her in
fine order for Dumfries fair; when four or five days before the fair,
she was seized with an unaccountable disorder in the sinews, or
somewhere in the bones of the neck; with a weakness or total want of
power in her fillets, and in short the whole vertebrae of her spine
seemed to be diseased and unhinged, and in eight-and-forty hours, in
spite of the two best farriers in the country, she died and be d&mdash;mned
to her! The farriers said that she had been quite strained in the
fillets beyond cure before you had bought her; and that the poor
devil, though she might keep a little flesh, had been jaded and quite
worn out with fatigue and oppression. While she was with me, she was
under my own eye, and I assure you, my much valued friend, everything
was done for her that could be done; and the accident has vexed me to
the heart. In fact I could not pluck up spirits to write to you, on
account of the unfortunate business.</p>

<p>There is little new in this country. Our theatrical company, of which
you must have heard, leave us this week.&mdash;Their merit and character
are indeed very great, both on the stage and in private life; not a
worthless creature among them; and their encouragement has been
accordingly. Their usual run is from eighteen to twenty-five pounds a
night: seldom less than the one, and the house will hold no more than
the other. There have been repeated instances of sending away six, and
eight, and ten pounds a night for want of room. A new theatre is to be
built by subscription; the first stone is to be laid on Friday first
to come. Three hundred guineas have been raised by thirty subscribers,
and thirty more might have been got if wanted. The manager, Mr.
Sutherland, was introduced to me by a friend from Ayr; and a worthier
or cleverer fellow I have rarely met with. Some of our clergy have
slipt in by stealth now and then; but they have got up a farce of
their own. You must have heard how the Rev. Mr. Lawson of Kirkmahoe,
seconded by the Rev. Mr. Kirkpatrick of Dunscore, and the rest of that
faction, have accused in formal process, the unfortunate and Rev. Mr.
Heron, of Kirkgunzeon, that in ordaining Mr. Nielson to the cure of
souls in Kirkbean, he, the said Heron, feloniously and treasonably
bound the said Nielson to the confession of faith, <i>so far as it was
agreeable to reason and the word of God</i>!</p>

<p>Mrs. B. begs to be remembered most gratefully to you. Little Bobby and
Frank are charmingly well and healthy. I am jaded to death with
fatigue. For these two or three months, on an average, I have not
ridden less than two hundred miles per week. I have done little in the
poetic way. I have given Mr. Sutherland two Prologues; one of which
was delivered last week. I have likewise strung four or five barbarous
stanzas, to the tune of Chevy Chase, by way of Elegy on your poor
unfortunate mare, beginning (the name she got here was Peg Nicholson)</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;My poverty but not my will consents.&#8221;</p></div>

unpolite scoundrel, Necessity, has driven from Burgundy and Pineapple,
to a dish of Bohea, with the scandal-bearing help-mate of a

yoke-fellow of a foot-padding exciseman&mdash;I make a vow to enclose this

<p>I am indeed your unworthy debtor for three friendly letters. I ought
to have written to you long ere now, but it is a literal fact, I have
scarcely a spare moment. It is not that I <i>will not</i> write to you;
Miss Burnet is not more dear to her guardian angel, nor his grace the
Duke of Queensbury to the powers of darkness, than my friend
Cunningham to me. It is not that I <i>cannot</i> write to you; should you
doubt it, take the following fragment, which was intended for you some
time ago, and be convinced that I can <i>antithesize</i> sentiment, and
<i>circumvolute</i> periods, as well as any coiner of phrase in the regions
of philology.</p>

<p class="sig"><i>December, 1789.</i></p>

<p class="sig7"><span class="smcap">My dear Cunningham</span>,</p>

<p>Where are you? And what are you doing? Can you be that son of levity,
who takes up a friendship as he takes up a fashion; or are you, like
some other of the worthiest fellows in the world, the victim of
indolence, laden with fetters of ever-increasing weight?</p>

<p>What strange beings we are! Since we have a portion of conscious
existence, equally capable of enjoying pleasure, happiness, and
rapture, or of suffering pain, wretchedness, and misery, it is surely
worthy of an inquiry, whether there be not such a thing as a science
of life; whether method, economy, and fertility of expedients be not
applicable to enjoyment, and whether there be not a want of dexterity
in pleasure, which renders our little scantling of happiness still
less; and a profuseness, an intoxication in bliss, which leads to
satiety, disgust, and self-abhorrence. There is not a doubt but that
health, talents, character, decent competency, respectable friends,
are real substantial blessings; and yet do we not daily see those who
enjoy many or all of these good things contrive notwithstanding to be
as unhappy as others to whose lot few of them have fallen? I believe
one great source of this mistake or misconduct is owing to a certain
stimulus, with us called ambition, which goads us up the hill of life,
not as we ascend other eminences, for the laudable curiosity of

am deeply read in Boston&#8217;s Four-fold State, Marshal on Sanctification,
Guthrie&#8217;s Trial of a Saving Interest, &amp;c.; but &#8220;there is no balm in

<p>Luckily for me, I was prevented from the discussion of the knotty
point at which I had just made a full stop. All my fears and care are
of this world: if there is another, an honest man has nothing to fear
from it. I hate a man that wishes to be a Deist: but I fear, every
fair, unprejudiced inquirer must in some degree be a sceptic. It is
not that there are any very staggering arguments against the
immortality of man; but like electricity, phlogiston, &amp;c., the subject
is so involved in darkness, that we want data to go upon. One thing
frightens me much: that we are to live for ever, seems <i>too good news
to be true.</i> That we are to enter into a new scene of existence,
where, exempt from want and pain, we shall enjoy ourselves and our
friends without satiety or separation&mdash;how much should I be indebted
to any one who could fully assure me that this was certain!</p>

<p>My time is once more expired. I will write to Mr. Cleghorn soon. God
bless him and all his concerns! And may all the powers that preside
over conviviality and friendship, be present with all their kindest
influence, when the bearer of this, Mr. Syme, and you meet! I wish I
could also make one.</p>

<p>Finally, brethren, farewell! Whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever
things are gentle, whatsoever things are charitable, whatsoever things
are kind, think on these things, and think on</p>

<h3>TO MR. PETER HILL.</h3>

<p>[That Burns turned at this time his thoughts on the drama, this order
to his bookseller for dramatic works, as well as his attendances at
the Dumfries theatre, afford proof.]</p>

<p class="sig"><i>Ellisland, 2d March, 1790.</i></p>

<p>At a late meeting of the Monkland Friendly Society, it was resolved to
augment their library by the following books, which you are to send us
as soon as possible:&mdash;The Mirror, The Lounger, Man of Feeling, Man of
the World, (these, for my own sake, I wish to have by the first
carrier), Knox&#8217;s History of the Reformation; Rae&#8217;s History of the
Rebellion in 1715; any good history of the rebellion in 1745; A
Display of the Secession Act and Testimony, by Mr. Gibb; Hervey&#8217;s
Meditations; Beveridge&#8217;s Thoughts; and another copy of Watson&#8217;s Body
of Divinity.</p>

<p>I wrote to Mr. A. Masterton three or four months ago, to pay some
money he owed me into your hands, and lately I wrote to you to the
same purpose, but I have heard from neither one or other of you.</p>

<p>In addition to the books I commissioned in my last, I want very much
An Index to the Excise Laws, or an Abridgment of all the Statutes now
in force relative to the Excise, by Jellinger Symons; I want three
copies of this book: if it is now to be had, cheap or dear, get it for
me. An honest country neighbour of mine wants too a Family Bible, the
larger the better; but second-handed, for he does not choose to give
above ten shillings for the book. I want likewise for myself, as you
can pick them up, second-handed or cheap, copies of Otway&#8217;s Dramatic
Works, Ben Jonson&#8217;s, Dryden&#8217;s, Congreve&#8217;s, Wycherley&#8217;s, Vanbrugh&#8217;s,
Cibber&#8217;s, or any dramatic works of the more modern, Macklin, Garrick,
Foote, Colman, or Sheridan. A good copy too of Moliere, in French, I
much want. Any other good dramatic authors in that language I want
also; but comic authors, chiefly, though I should wish to have Racine,
Corneille, and Voltaire too. I am in no hurry for all, or any of
these, but if you accidentally meet with them very cheap, get them for
me.</p>

<p>And now to quit the dry walk of business, how do you do, my dear
friend? and how is Mrs. Hill? I trust, if now and then not so
<i>elegantly</i> handsome, at least as amiable, and sings as divinely as
ever. My good wife too has a charming &#8220;wood-note wild;&#8221; now could we
four &mdash;&mdash;.</p>

<p>I am out of all patience with this vile world, for one thing. Mankind
are by nature benevolent creatures, except in a few scoundrelly
instances. I do not think that avarice of the good things we chance to
have, is born with us; but we are placed here amid so much nakedness,
and hunger, and poverty, and want, that we are under a cursed
necessity of studying selfishness, in order that we may
<span class="smcap">exist</span>! Still there are, in every age, a few souls, that all
the wants and woes of life cannot debase to selfishness, or even to
the necessary alloy of caution and prudence. If ever I am in danger of
vanity, it is when I contemplate myself on this side of my disposition
and character. God knows I am no saint; I have a whole host of follies
and sin, to answer for; but if I could, and I believe I do it as far
as I can, I would wipe away all tears from all eyes.</p>

<h3>TO MRS. DUNLOP.</h3>

<p>[It is not a little singular that Burns says, in this letter, he had
just met with the Mirror and Lounger for the first time: it will be
remembered that a few years before a generous article was dedicated by
Mackenzie, the editor, to the Poems of Burns, and to this the poet
often alludes in his correspondence.]</p>

<p class="sig"><i>Ellisland, 10th April, 1790.</i></p>

<p>I have just now, my ever honoured friend, enjoyed a very high luxury,
in reading a paper of the Lounger. You know my national prejudices. I
had often read and admired the Spectator, Adventurer, Rambler, and
World; but still with a certain regret, that they were so thoroughly
and entirely English. Alas! have I often said to myself, what are all
the boasted advantages which my country reaps from the union, that can
counterbalance the annihilation of her independence, and even her very
name! I often repeat that couplet of my favourite poet, Goldsmith&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; States of native liberty possest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tho&#8217; very poor, may yet be very blest.&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Nothing can reconcile me to the common terms, &#8220;English ambassador,
English court,&#8221; &amp;c. And I am out of all patience to see that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[424]</a></span>
equivocal character, Hastings, impeached by &#8220;the Commons of England.&#8221;
Tell me, my friend, is this weak prejudice? I believe in my conscience
such ideas as &#8220;my country; her independence; her honour; the
illustrious names that mark the history of my native land;&#8221; &amp;c.&mdash;I
believe these, among your <i>men of the world</i>, men who in fact guide
for the most part and govern our world, are looked on as so many
modifications of wrongheadedness. They know the use of bawling out
such terms, to rouse or lead <span class="smcap">the rabble</span>; but for their own
private use, with almost all the <i>able statesmen</i> that ever existed,
or now exist, when they talk of right and wrong, they only mean proper
and improper; and their measure of conduct is, not what they
<span class="smcap">ought</span>, but what they <span class="smcap">dare</span>. For the truth of this I
shall not ransack the history of nations, but appeal to one of the
ablest judges of men that ever lived&mdash;the celebrated Earl of
Chesterfield. In fact, a man who could thoroughly control his vices
whenever they interfered with his interests, and who could completely
put on the appearance of every virtue as often as it suited his
purposes, is, on the Stanhopean plan, the <i>perfect man</i>; a man to lead
nations. But are great abilities, complete without a flaw, and
polished without a blemish, the standard of human excellence? This is
certainly the staunch opinion of <i>men of the world</i>; but I call on
honour, virtue, and worth, to give the stygian doctrine a loud
negative! However, this must be allowed, that, if you abstract from
man the idea of an existence beyond the grave, <i>then</i> the true measure
of human conduct is, <i>proper</i> and <i>improper</i>: virtue and vice, as
dispositions of the heart, are, in that case, of scarcely the same
import and value to the world at large, as harmony and discord in the
modifications of sound; and a delicate sense of honour, like a nice
ear for music, though it may sometimes give the possessor an ecstasy
unknown to the coarser organs of the herd, yet, considering the harsh
gratings, and inharmonic jars, in this ill-tuned state of being, it is
odds but the individual would be as happy, and certainly would be as
much respected by the true judges of society as it would then stand,
without either a good ear or a good heart.</p>

<p>You must know I have just met with the Mirror and Lounger for the
first time, and I am quite in raptures with them; I should be glad to
have your opinion of some of the papers. The one I have just read,
Lounger, No. 61, has cost me more honest tears than anything I have
read of a long time. Mackenzie has been called the Addison of the
Scots, and in my opinion, Addison would not be hurt at the comparison.
If he has not Addison&#8217;s exquisite humour, he as certainly outdoes him
in the tender and the pathetic. His Man of Feeling (but I am not
counsel learned in the laws of criticism) I estimate as the first
performance in its kind I ever saw. From what book, moral or even
pious, will the susceptible young mind receive impressions more
congenial to humanity and kindness, generosity and benevolence; in
short, more of all that ennobles the soul to herself, or endears her
to others&mdash;than from the simple affecting tale of poor Harley?</p>

<p>Still, with all my admiration of Mackenzie&#8217;s writings, I do not know
if they are the fittest reading for a young man who is about to set
out, as the phrase is, to make his way into life. Do not you think,
Madam, that among the few favoured of heaven in the structure of their
minds (for such there certainly are) there may be a purity, a
tenderness, a dignity, an elegance of soul, which are of no use, nay,
in some degree, absolutely disqualifying for the truly important
business of making a man&#8217;s way into life? If I am not much mistaken,
my gallant young friend, A * * * * * *, is very much under these
disqualifications; and for the young females of a family I could
mention, well may they excite parental solicitude, for I, a common
acquaintance, or as my vanity will have it, an humble friend, have
often trembled for a turn of mind which may render them eminently
happy&mdash;or peculiarly miserable!</p>

<p>I have been manufacturing some verses lately; but when I have got the
most hurried season of excise business over, I hope to have more
leisure to transcribe anything that may show how much I have the
honour to be, Madam,</p>

<p class="sig"><i>Dumfries, Excise-Office, 14th July, 1790.</i></p>

<p class="sig7"><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>

<p>Coming into town this morning, to attend my duty in this office, it
being collection-day, I met with a gentleman who tells me he is on his
way to London; so I take the opportunity of writing to you, as
franking is at present under a temporary death. I shall have some
snatches of leisure through the day, amid our horrid business and
bustle, and I shall improve them as well as I can; but let my letter
be as stupid as * * * * * * * * *, as miscellaneous as a newspaper, as short as a
hungry grace-before-meat, or as long as a law-paper in the Douglas
cause; as ill-spelt as country John&#8217;s billet-doux, or as unsightly a
scrawl as Betty Byre-Mucker&#8217;s answer to it; I hope, considering
circumstances, you will forgive it; and as it will put you to no
expense of postage, I shall have the less reflection about it.</p>

<p>I am sadly ungrateful in not returning you my thanks for your most
valuable present, <i>Zeluco.</i> In fact, you are in some degree blameable
for my neglect. You were pleased to express a wish for my opinion of
the work, which so flattered me, that nothing less would serve my
overweening fancy, than a formal criticism on the book. In fact, I
have gravely planned a comparative view of you, Fielding, Richardson,
and Smollett, in your different qualities and merits as novel-writers.
This, I own, betrays my ridiculous vanity, and I may probably never
bring the business to bear; and I am fond of the spirit young Elihu
shows in the book of Job&mdash;&#8220;And I said, I will also declare my
opinion,&#8221; I have quite disfigured my copy of the book with my
annotations. I never take it up without at the same time taking my
pencil, and marking with asterisms, parentheses, &amp;c., wherever I meet
with an original thought, a nervous remark on life and manners, a
remarkable well-turned period, or a character sketched with uncommon
precision.</p>

<p>Though I should hardly think of fairly writing out my &#8220;Comparative
View,&#8221; I shall certainly trouble you with my remarks, such as they
are.</p>

<p>I have just received from my gentleman that horrid summons in the book
of Revelations&mdash;&#8220;That time shall be no more!&#8221;</p>

<p>The little collection of sonnets have some charming poetry in them. If
<i>indeed</i> I am indebted to the fair author for the book, and not, as I
rather suspect, to a celebrated author of the other sex, I should
certainly have written to the lady, with my grateful acknowledgments,
and my own ideas of the comparative excellence of her pieces. I would
do this last, not from any vanity of thinking that my remarks could be
of much consequence to Mrs. Smith, but merely from my own feelings as
an author, doing as I would be done by.</p>

<p class="sig7"><span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,</p>

<p>I received a letter from you a long time ago,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[426]</a></span> but unfortunately, as
it was in the time of my peregrinations and journeyings through
Scotland, I mislaid or lost it, and by consequence your direction
along with it. Luckily my good star brought me acquainted with Mr.
Kennedy, who, I understand, is an acquaintance of yours: and by his
means and mediation I hope to replace that link which my unfortunate
negligence had so unluckily broke in the chain of our correspondence.
I was the more vexed at the vile accident, as my brother William, a
journeyman saddler, has been for some time in London; and wished above
all things for your direction, that he might have paid his respects to
his father&#8217;s friend.</p>

<p>His last address he sent me was, &#8220;Wm. Burns, at Mr. Barber&#8217;s, saddler,
No. 181, Strand.&#8221; I writ him by Mr. Kennedy, but neglected to ask him
for your address; so, if you find a spare half-minute, please let my
brother know by a card where and when he will find you, and the poor
fellow will joyfully wait on you, as one of the few surviving friends
of the man whose name, and Christian name too, he has the honour to
bear.</p>

<p>The next letter I write you shall be a long one. I have much to tell
you of &#8220;hair-breadth &#8216;scapes in th&#8217; imminent deadly breach,&#8221; with all

am, if I choose (and who would not choose) to bind down with the

<p>Enclosed I have sent you a sample of the old pieces that are still to
be found among our peasantry in the west. I had once a great many of
these fragments, and some of these here, entire; but as I had no idea
then that anybody cared for them, I have forgotten them. I invariably
hold it sacrilege to add anything of my own to help out with the
shattered wrecks of these venerable old compositions; but they have
many various readings. If you have not seen these before, I know they
will flatter your true old-style Caledonian feelings; at any rate I am
truly happy to have an opportunity of assuring you how sincerely I am,
revered Sir,</p>

<p>[Margaret Chalmers had now, it appears by this letter, become Mrs.

Adair, of Scarborough: Miss Nimmo was the lady who introduced Burns to
the far-famed Clarinda.]</p>

<p class="sig"><i>Ellisland</i>, 15th <i>October, 1790.</i></p>

<p class="sig7"><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,</p>

<p>Allow me to introduce to your acquaintance the bearer, Mr. Wm. Duncan,
a friend of mine, whom I have long known and long loved. His father,
whose only son he is, has a decent little property in Ayrshire, and
has bred the young man to the law, in which department he comes up an
adventurer to your good town. I shall give you my friend&#8217;s character
in two words: as to his head, he has talents enough, and more than
enough for common life; as to his heart, when nature had kneaded the
kindly clay that composes it, she said, &#8220;I can no more.&#8221;</p>

<p>You, my good Sir, were born under kinder stars; but your fraternal
sympathy, I well know<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[428]</a></span> can enter into the feelings of the young man,
who goes into life with the laudable ambition to <i>do</i> something, and
to <i>be</i> something among his fellow-creatures; but whom the
consciousness of friendless obscurity presses to the earth, and wounds
to the soul!</p>

<p>Even the fairest of his virtues are against him. That independent
spirit, and that ingenuous modesty, qualities inseparable from a noble
mind, are, with the million, circumstances not a little disqualifying.
What pleasure is in the power of the fortunate and the happy, by their
notice and patronage, to brighten the countenance and glad the heart
of such depressed youth! I am not so angry with mankind for their deaf
economy of the purse:&mdash;the goods of this world cannot be divided
without being lessened&mdash;but why be a niggard of that which bestows
bliss on a fellow-creature, yet takes nothing from our own means of
enjoyment? We wrap ourselves up in the cloak of our own better
fortune, and turn away our eyes, lest the wants and woes of our
brother-mortals should disturb the selfish apathy of our souls!</p>

<p>I am the worst hand in the world at asking a favour. That indirect
address, that insinuating implication, which, without any positive
request, plainly expresses your wish, is a talent not to be acquired
at a plough-tail. Tell me then, for you can, in what periphrasis of
language, in what circumvolution of phrase, I shall envelope, yet not
conceal this plain story.&mdash;&#8220;My dear Mr. Tait, my friend Mr. Duncan,
whom I have the pleasure of introducing to you, is a young lad of your
own profession, and a gentleman of much modesty, and great worth.
Perhaps it may be in your power to assist him in the, to him,
important consideration of getting a place; but at all events, your
notice and acquaintance will be a very great acquisition to him; and I
dare pledge myself that he will never disgrace your favour.&#8221;</p>

<p>You may possibly be surprised, Sir, at such a letter from me; &#8217;tis, I
own, in the usual way of calculating these matters, more than our
acquaintance entitles me to; but my answer is short:&mdash;Of all the men
at your time of life, whom I knew in Edinburgh, you are the most
accessible on the side on which I have assailed you. You are very much
altered indeed from what you were when I knew you, if generosity point
the path you will not tread, or humanity call to you in vain.</p>

<p>As to myself, a being to whose interest I believe you are still a
well-wisher; I am here, breathing at all times, thinking sometimes,
and rhyming now and then. Every situation has its share of the cares
and pains of life, and my situation I am persuaded has a full ordinary
allowance of its pleasures and enjoyments.</p>

<p>My best compliments to your father and Miss Tait. If you have an
opportunity, please remember me in the solemn league and covenant of
friendship to Mrs. Lewis Hay. I am a wretch for not writing her; but I
am so hackneyed with self-accusation in that way, that my conscience
lies in my bosom with scarce the sensibility of an oyster in its
shell. Where is Lady M&#8217;Kenzie? wherever she is, God bless her! I
likewise beg leave to trouble you with compliments to Mr. Wm.
Hamilton; Mrs. Hamilton and family; and Mrs. Chalmers, when you are in
that country. Should you meet with Miss Nimmo, please remember me
kindly to her.</p>

<p>Whether in the way of my trade I can be of any service to the Rev.
Doctor, is I fear very doubtful. Ajax&#8217;s shield consisted, I think, of
seven bull-hides and a plate of brass, which altogether set Hector&#8217;s
utmost force at defiance. Alas! I am not a Hector, and the worthy
Doctor&#8217;s foes are as securely armed as Ajax was. Ignorance,
superstition, bigotry, stupidity, malevolence, self-conceit, envy&mdash;all
strongly bound in a massy frame of brazen impudence. Good God, Sir! to
such a shield, humour is the peck of a sparrow, and satire the pop-gun
of a school-boy. Creation-disgracing scelerats such as they, God only
can mend, and the devil only can punish. In the comprehending way of
Caligula, I wish they all had but one neck. I feel impotent as a child
to the ardour of my wishes! O for a withering curse to blast the
germins of their wicked machinations! O for a poisonous tornado,
winged from the torrid zone of Tar<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[429]</a></span>tarus, to sweep the spreading crop
of their villainous contrivances to the lowest hell!</p>

<h3>TO MRS. DUNLOP.</h3>

<p>[The poet wrote out several copies of Tam o&#8217; Shanter and sent them to
his friends, requesting their criticisms: he wrote few poems so
universally applauded.]</p>

<p class="sig"><i>Ellisland, November, 1790.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;As cold waters to a thirsty soul, so is good news from a far
country.&#8221;</p>

<p>Fate has long owed me a letter of good news from you, in return for
the many tidings of sorrow which I have received. In this instance I
most cordially obey the apostle&mdash;&#8220;Rejoice with them that do
rejoice&#8221;&mdash;for me, <i>to sing</i> for joy, is no new thing; but <i>to preach</i>
for joy, as I have done in the commencement of this epistle, is a
pitch of extravagant rapture to which I never rose before.</p>

<p>I read your letter&mdash;I literally jumped for joy&mdash;How could such a
mercurial creature as a poet lumpishly keep his seat on the receipt of
the best news from his best friend. I seized my gilt-headed Wangee
rod, an instrument indispensably necessary in my left hand, in the
moment of inspiration and rapture; and stride, stride&mdash;quick and
quicker&mdash;out skipt I among the broomy banks of Nith to muse over my
joy by retail. To keep within the bounds of prose was impossible. Mrs.
Little&#8217;s is a more elegant, but not a more sincere compliment to the
sweet little fellow, than I, extempore almost, poured out to him in
the following verses:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Sweet flow&#8217;ret, pledge o&#8217; meikle love<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And ward o&#8217; mony a prayer,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">But gane, alas! the shelt&#8217;ring tree<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Should shield thee frae the storm.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>I am much flattered by your approbation of my <i>Tam o&#8217; Shanter</i>, which
you express in your former letter; though, by the bye, you load me in
that said letter with accusations heavy and many; to all which I
plead, <i>not guilty</i>! Your book is, I hear, on the road to reach me. As
to printing of poetry, when you prepare it for the press, you have
only to spell it right, and place the capital letters properly: as to
the punctuation, the printers do that themselves.</p>

<p>I have a copy of <i>Tam o&#8217; Shanter</i> ready to send you by the first
opportunity: it is too heavy to send by post.</p>

<p>I heard of Mr. Corbet lately. He, in consequence of your
recommendation, is most zealous to serve me. Please favour me soon
with an account of your good folks; if Mrs. H. is recovering, and the
young gentleman doing well.</p>

<p>Many happy returns of the season await my friend. May the thorns of
care never beset his path! May peace be an inmate of his bosom, and
rapture a frequent visitor of his soul! May the blood-hounds of
misfortune never track his steps, nor the screech-owl of sorrow alarm
his dwelling! May enjoyment tell thy hours, and pleasure number thy
days, thou friend of the bard! &#8220;Blessed be he that blesseth thee, and
cursed be he that curseth thee!!!&#8221;</p>

<p>As a further proof that I am still in the land of existence, I send
you a poem, the latest I have composed. I have a particular reason for
wishing you only to show it to select friends, should you think it
worthy a friend&#8217;s perusal; but if, at your first leisure hour, you
will favour me with your opinion of, and strictures on the
performance, it will be an additional obligation on, dear Sir, your

<h3>TO MR. PETER HILL.</h3>

<p>[The poet&#8217;s eloquent apostrophe to poverty has no little feeling in

and he looked to the future with more fear than hope.]</p>

<p>Take these two guineas, and place them over against that d&mdash;mned
account of yours! which has gagged my mouth these five or six months!
I can as little write good things as apologies to the man I owe money
to. O the supreme curse of making three guineas do the business of
five! Not all the labours of Hercules; not all the Hebrews&#8217; three
centuries of Egyptian bondage, were such an insuperable business, such
an infernal task!! Poverty! thou half-sister of death, thou
cousin-german of hell: where shall I find force of execration equal to
the amplitude of thy demerits? Oppressed by thee, the venerable
ancient, grown hoary in the practice of every virtue, laden with years
and wretchedness, implores a little&mdash;little aid to support his
existence, from a stony-hearted son of Mammon, whose sun of prosperity
never knew a cloud; and is by him denied and insulted. Oppressed by
thee, the man of sentiment, whose heart glows with independence, and
melts with sensibility, inly pines under the neglect, or writhes in
bitterness of soul, under the contumely of arrogant, unfeeling wealth.
Oppressed by thee, the son of genius, whose ill-starred ambition
plants him at the tables of the fashionable and polite, must see in
suffering silence, his remark neglected, and his person despised,
while shallow greatness in his idiot attempts at wit, shall meet with
countenance and applause. Nor is it only the family of worth that have
reason to complain of thee: the children of folly and vice, though in
common with thee the offspring of evil, smart equally under thy rod.
Owing to thee, the man of unfortunate disposition and neglected
education, is condemned as a fool for his dissipation, despised and
shunned as a needy wretch, when his follies as usual bring him to
want; and when his unprincipled necessities drive him to dishonest
practices, he is abhorred as a miscreant, and perishes by the justice
of his country. But far otherwise is the lot of the man of family and
fortune. <i>His</i> early follies and extravagance, are spirit and fire;
<i>his</i> consequent wants are the embarrassments of an honest fellow; and
when, to remedy the matter, he has gained a legal commission to
plunder distant provinces, or massacre peaceful nations, he returns,
perhaps, laden with the spoils of rapine and murder; lives wicked and
respected, and dies a scoundrel and a lord.&mdash;Nay, worst of all, alas
for helpless woman! the needy prostitute, who has shivered at the
corner of the street, waiting to earn the wages of casual
prostitution, is left neglected and insulted, ridden down by the
chariot wheels of the coroneted <span class="smcap">Rip</span>, hurrying on to the
guilty assignation; she who without the same necessities to plead,
riots nightly in the same guilty trade.</p>

<p>Well! divines may say of it what they please; but execration is to the
mind what phlebotomy is to the body: the vital sluices of both are
wonderfully relieved by their respective evacuations.</p>

<p>Nothing less than the unfortunate accident I have met with, could have
prevented my grateful acknowledgments for your letter. His own
favourite poem, and that an essay in the walk of the muses entirely
new to him, where consequently his hopes and fears were on the most
anxious alarm for his success in the attempt; to have that poem so
much applauded by one of the first judges, was the most delicious
vibration that ever thrilled along the heart-strings of a poor poet.
However, Providence, to keep up the proper proportion of evil with the
good, which it seems is necessary in this sublunary state, thought
proper to check my exultation by a very serious misfortune. A day or
two after I received your letter, my horse came down with me and broke
my right arm. As this is the first service my arm has done me since
its disaster, I find myself unable to do more than just in general
terms thank you for this additional instance of your patronage and
friendship. As to the faults you detected in the piece, they are truly
there: one of them, the hit at the lawyer and priest, I shall cut out;
as to the falling off in the catastrophe, for the reason you justly
adduce, it cannot easily be remedied. Your approbation, Sir, has given
me such additional spirits to persevere in this species of poetic
composition, that I am already revolving two or three stories in my
fancy. If I can bring these floating ideas to bear any kind of
embodied form, it will give me additional opportunity of assuring you
how much I have the honour to be, &amp;c.</p>

<p>[The elegy on the beautiful Miss Burnet, of Monboddo, was laboured
zealously by Burns, but it never reached the excellence of some of his
other compositions.]</p>

<p class="sig"><i>Ellisland, 7th Feb. 1791.</i></p>

<p>When I tell you, Madam, that by a fall, not from my horse, but with my
horse, I have been a cripple some time, and that this is the first day
my arm and hand have been able to serve me in writing; you will allow
that it is too good an apology for my seemingly ungrateful silence. I
am now getting better, and am able to rhyme a little, which implies
some tolerable ease, as I cannot think that the most poetic genius is
able to compose on the rack.</p>

<p>I do not remember if ever I mentioned to you my having an idea of
composing an elegy on the late Miss Burnet, of Monboddo. I had the
honour of being pretty well acquainted with her, and have seldom felt
so much at the loss of an acquaintance, as when I heard that so
amiable and accomplished a piece of God&#8217;s work was no more. I have, as
yet, gone no farther than the following fragment, of which please let
me have your opinion. You know that elegy is a subject so much
exhausted, that any new idea on the business is not to be expected:
&#8217;tis well if we can place an old idea in a new light. How far I have
succeeded as to this last, you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[432]</a></span> will judge from what follows. I have
proceeded no further.</p>

<p>Your kind letter, with your kind <i>remembrance</i> of your godson, came
safe. This last, Madam, is scarcely what my pride can bear. As to the
little fellow, he is, partiality apart, the finest boy I have for a
long time seen. He is now seventeen months old, has the small-pox and
measles over, has cut several teeth, and never had a grain of doctor&#8217;s
drugs in his bowels.</p>

<p>I am truly happy to hear that the &#8220;little floweret&#8221; is blooming so
fresh and fair, and that the &#8220;mother plant&#8221; is rather recovering her
drooping head. Soon and well may her &#8220;cruel wounds&#8221; be healed. I have

<p>You must by this time have set me down as one of the most ungrateful
of men. You did me the honour to present me with a book, which does
honour to science and the intellectual powers of man, and I have not
even so much as acknowledged the receipt of it. The fact is, you
yourself are to blame for it. Flattered as I was by your telling me
that you wished to have my opinion of the work, the old spiritual
enemy of mankind, who knows well that vanity is one of the sins that
most easily beset me, put it into my head to ponder over the
performance with the look-out of a critic, and to draw up forsooth a
deep learned digest of strictures on a composition, of which, in fact,
until I read the book, I did not even know the first principles. I
own, Sir, that at first glance, several of your propositions startled
me as paradoxical. That the martial clangour of a trumpet had
something in it vastly more grand, heroic, and sublime, than the
twingle twangle of a jew&#8217;s-harp: that the delicate flexure of a
rose-twig, when the half-blown flower is heavy with the tears of the
dawn, was infinitely more beautiful and elegant than the upright stub
of a burdock; and that from something innate and independent of all
associations of ideas;&mdash;these I had set down as irrefragable, orthodox
truths, until perusing your book shook my faith.&mdash;In short, Sir,
except Euclid&#8217;s Elements of Geometry, which I made a shift to unravel
by my father&#8217;s fire-side, in the winter evening of the first season I
held the plough, I never read a book which gave me such a quantum of
information, and added so much to my stock of ideas, as your &#8220;Essays
on the Principles of Taste.&#8221; One thing, Sir, you must forgive my
mentioning as an uncommon merit in the work, I mean the language. To
clothe abstract philosophy in elegance of style, sounds something like
a contradiction in terms; but you have convinced me that they are
quite compatible.</p>

of poetical beauties.&mdash;He again regrets that he writes in the language
of Scotland.]</p>

<p class="sig"><i>Ellisland, 20th February, 1791.</i></p>

<p>I do not know, Sir, whether you are a subscriber to <i>Grose&#8217;s
Antiquities of Scotland.</i> If you are, the enclosed poem will not be
altogether new to you. Captain Grose did me the favour to send me a
dozen copies of the proof sheet, of which this is one. Should you have
read the piece before, still this will answer the principal end I have
in view: it will give me another opportunity of thanking you for all
your goodness to the rustic bard; and also of showing you, that the
abilities you have been pleased to commend and patronize are still
employed in the way you wish.</p>

<p>The <i>Elegy on Captain Henderson</i>, is a tribute to the memory of a man
I loved much. Poets
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[433]</a></span>
have in this the same advantage as Roman Catholics; they can be of
service to their friends after they have passed that bourne where all
other kindness ceases to be of avail. Whether, after all, either the
one or the other be of any real service to the dead, is, I fear, very
problematical; but I am sure they are highly gratifying to the living:
and as a very orthodox text, I forget where in scripture, says,
&#8220;whatsoever is not of faith is sin;&#8221; so say I, whatsoever is not
detrimental to society, and is of positive enjoyment, is of God, the
giver of all good things, and ought to be received and enjoyed by his
creatures with thankful delight. As almost all my religious tenets
originate from my heart, I am wonderfully pleased with the idea, that
I can still keep up a tender intercourse with the dearly beloved
friend, or still more dearly beloved mistress, who is gone to the
world of spirits.</p>

<p>The ballad on Queen Mary was begun while I was busy with <i>Percy&#8217;s
Reliques of English Poetry.</i> By the way, how much is every honest
heart, which has a tincture of Caledonian prejudice, obliged to you
for your glorious story of Buchanan and Targe! &#8217;Twas an unequivocal
proof of your loyal gallantry of soul, giving Targe the victory. I
should have been mortified to the ground if you had not.</p>

<p>I have just read over, once more of many times, your <i>Zeluco.</i> I
marked with my pencil, as I went along, every passage that pleased me
particularly above the rest; and one or two, I think, which with
humble deference, I am disposed to think unequal to the merits of the
book. I have sometimes thought to transcribe these marked passages, or
at least so much of them as to point where they are, and send them to
you. Original strokes that strongly depict the human heart, is your
and Fielding&#8217;s province beyond any other novelist I have ever perused.
Richardson indeed might perhaps be excepted; but unhappily, <i>dramatis
person&aelig;</i> are beings of another world; and however they may captivate
the unexperienced, romantic fancy of a boy or a girl, they will ever,
in proportion as we have made human nature our study, dissatisfy our
riper years.</p>

<p>As to my private concerns, I am going on, a mighty tax-gatherer before
the Lord, and have lately had the interest to get myself ranked on the
list of excise as a supervisor. I am not yet employed as such, but in
a few years I shall fall into the file of supervisorship by seniority.
I have had an immense loss in the death of the Earl of Glencairn; the
patron from whom all my fame and fortune took its rise. Independent of
my grateful attachment to him, which was indeed so strong that it
pervaded my very soul, and was entwined with the thread of my
existence: so soon as the prince&#8217;s friends had got in (and every dog
you know has his day), my getting forward in the excise would have
been an easier business than otherwise it will be. Though this was a
consummation devoutly to be wished, yet, thank Heaven, I can live and
rhyme as I am: and as to my boys, poor little fellows! if I cannot
place them on as high an elevation in life, as I could wish, I shall,
if I am favoured so much of the Disposer of events as to see that
period, fix them on as broad and independent a basis as possible.
Among the many wise adages which have been treasured up by our
Scottish ancestors, this is one of the best, <i>Better be the head o&#8217;
the commonalty, than the tail o&#8217; the gentry.</i></p>

<p>But I am got on a subject, which however interesting to me, is of no
manner of consequence to you; so I shall give you a short poem on the
other page, and close this with assuring you how sincerely I have the
honour to be,</p>

<h3>TO MR. CUNNINGHAM.</h3>

<p>If the foregoing piece be worth your strictures, let me have them. For
my own part, a thing that I have just composed always appears through
a double portion of that partial medium in which an author will ever
view his own works. I believe in general, novelty has something in it
that inebriates the fancy, and not unfrequently dissipates and fumes
away like other intoxication, and leaves the poor patient, as usual,
with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[434]</a></span> an aching heart. A striking instance of this might be adduced,
in the revolution of many a hymeneal honeymoon. But lest I sink into
stupid prose, and so sacrilegiously intrude on the office of my
parish-priest, I shall fill up the page in my own way, and give you
another song of my late composition, which will appear perhaps in
Johnson&#8217;s work, as well as the former.</p>

<p>You must know a beautiful Jacobite air, <i>There&#8217;ll never be peace &#8217;till
Jamie comes hame.</i> When political combustion ceases to be the object
of princes and patriots, it then you know becomes the lawful prey of
historians and poets.</p>

<span class="i0">There&#8217;ll never be peace till Jamie comes hame.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>If you like the air, and if the stanzas hit your fancy, you cannot
imagine, my dear friend, how much you would oblige me, if by the
charms of your delightful voice, you would give my honest effusion to
&#8220;the memory of joys that are past,&#8221; to the few friends whom you

<p>[Cromek says that Alexander Dalzel introduced the poetry of Burns to
the notice of the Earl of Glencairn, who carried the Kilmarnock
edition with him to Edinburgh, and begged that the poet would let him
know what his views in the world were, that he might further them.]</p>

<p class="sig7"><span class="smcap">My dear Sir,</span></p>

<p>I have taken the liberty to frank this letter to you, as it encloses
an idle poem of mine, which I send you; and God knows you may perhaps
pay dear enough for it if you read it through. Not that this is my own
opinion; but the author, by the time he has composed and corrected his
work, has quite pored away all his powers of critical discrimination.</p>

<p>I can easily guess from my own heart, what you have felt on a late
most melancholy event. God knows what I have suffered, at the loss of
my best friend, my first and dearest patron and benefactor; the man to
whom I owe all that I am and have! I am gone into mourning for him,
and with more sincerity of grief than I fear some will, who by
nature&#8217;s ties ought to feel on the occasion.</p>

<p>I will be exceedingly obliged to you, indeed, to let me know the news
of the noble family, how the poor mother and the two sisters support
their loss. I had a packet of poetic bagatelles ready to send to Lady
Betty, when I saw the fatal tidings in the newspaper. I see by the
same channel that the honoured REMAINS of my noble patron, are
designed to be brought to the family burial-place. Dare I trouble you
to let me know privately before the day of interment, that I may cross
the country, and steal among the crowd, to pay a tear to the last
sight of my ever revered benefactor? It will oblige me beyond
expression.</p>

<p>Whether it is that the story of our Mary Queen of Scots has a peculiar
effect on the feelings of a poet, or whether I have, in the enclosed
ballad, succeeded beyond my usual poetic success, I know not; but it
has pleased me beyond any effort of my muse for a good while<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[435]</a></span> past; on
that account I enclose it particularly to you. It is true, the purity
of my motives may be suspected. I am already deeply indebted to Mr.
Graham&#8217;s goodness; and what, <i>in the usual ways of men</i>, is of
infinitely greater importance, Mr. G. can do me service of the utmost
importance in time to come. I was born a poor dog; and however I may
occasionally pick a better bone than I used to do, I know I must live
and die poor: but I will indulge the flattering faith that my poetry
will considerably outlive my poverty; and without any fustian
affectation of spirit, I can promise and affirm, that it must be no
ordinary craving of the latter shall ever make me do anything
injurious to the honest fame of the former. Whatever may be my
failings, for failings are a part of human nature, may they ever be
those of a generous heart, and an independent mind! It is no fault of
mine that I was born to dependence; nor is it Mr. Graham&#8217;s chiefest
praise that he can command influence; but it is his merit to bestow,
not only with the kindness of a brother, but with the politeness of a
gentleman; and I trust it shall be mine, to receive with thankfulness,
and remember with undiminished gratitude.</p>

<h3>TO THE REV. G. BAIRD.</h3>

<p>[It was proposed to publish a new edition of the poems of Michael

eighty years old, and poor and helpless, and Burns was asked for a
poem to give a new impulse to the publication.]</p>

<p class="sig"><i>Ellisland, 1791.</i></p>

<p class="sig7"><span class="smcap">Reverend Sir</span>,</p>

<p>Why did you, my dear Sir, write to me in such a hesitating style on
the business of poor Bruce? Don&#8217;t I know, and have I not felt, the
many ills, the peculiar ills that poetic flesh is heir to? You shall
have your choice of all the unpublished poems I have; and had your
letter had my direction, so as to have reached me sooner (it only came
to my hand this moment), I should have directly put you out of
suspense on the subject. I only ask, that some prefatory advertisement
in the book, as well as the subscription bills, may bear, that the
publication is solely for the benefit of Bruce&#8217;s mother. I would not
put it in the power of ignorance to surmise, or malice to insinuate,
that I clubbed a share in the work from mercenary motives. Nor need
you give me credit for any remarkable generosity in my part of the
business. I have such a host of peccadilloes, failings, follies, and
backslidings (anybody but myself might perhaps give some of them a
worse appellation), that by way of some balance, however trifling, in
the account, I am fain to do any good that occurs in my very limited
power to a fellow-creature, just for the selfish purpose of clearing a
little the vista of retrospection.</p>

youth.]</p>

<p class="sig"><i>Ellisland, 11th April, 1791.</i></p>

<p>I am once more able, my honoured friend, to return you, with my own
hand, thanks for the many instances of your friendship, and
particularly for your kind anxiety in this last disaster, that my evil
genius had in store for me. However, life is chequered&mdash;joy and
sorrow&mdash;for on Saturday morning last, Mrs. Burns made me a present of
a fine boy; rather stouter, but not so handsome as your godson was at
his time of life. Indeed I look on your little namesake to be my <i>chef
d&#8217;&oelig;uvre</i> in that species of manufacture, as I look on Tam o&#8217;
Shanter to be my standard performance in the poetical line. &#8217;Tis<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[436]</a></span>
true, both the one and the other discover a spice of roguish waggery,
that might perhaps be as well spared; but then they also show, in my
opinion, a force of genius and a finishing polish that I despair of
ever excelling. Mrs. Burns is getting stout again, and laid as lustily
about her to-day at breakfast, as a reaper from the corn-ridge. That
is the peculiar privilege and blessing of our hale, sprightly damsels,
that are bred among the <i>hay and heather.</i> We cannot hope for that
highly polished mind, that charming delicacy of soul, which is found
among the female world in the more elevated stations of life, and
which is certainly by far the most bewitching charm in the famous
cestus of Venus. It is indeed such an inestimable treasure, that where
it can be had in its native heavenly purity, unstained by some one or
other of the many shades of affectation, and unalloyed by some one or
other of the many species of caprice, I declare to Heaven, I should
think it cheaply purchased at the expense of every other earthly good!
But as this angelic creature is, I am afraid, extremely rare in any
station and rank of life, and totally denied to such a humble one as
mine, we meaner mortals must put up with the next rank of female
excellence&mdash;as fine a figure and face we can produce as any rank of
life whatever; rustic, native grace; unaffected modesty, and unsullied
purity; nature&#8217;s mother-wit, and the rudiments of taste; a simplicity
of soul, unsuspicious of, because unacquainted with, the crooked ways
of a selfish, interested, disingenuous world; and the dearest charm of
all the rest, a yielding sweetness of disposition, and a generous
warmth of heart, grateful for love on our part, and ardently glowing
with a more than equal return; these, with a healthy frame, a sound,
vigorous constitution, which your higher ranks can scarcely ever hope
to enjoy, are the charms of lovely woman in my humble walk of life.</p>

<p>This is the greatest effort my broken arm has yet made. Do let me
hear, by first post, how <i>cher petit Monsieur</i> comes on with his
small-pox. May almighty goodness preserve and restore him!</p>

<h3>TO MR. CUNNINGHAM.</h3>

<p>[To Clarke, the Schoolmaster, Burns, it is said, addressed several
letters, which on his death were put into the fire by his widow,
because of their license of language.]</p>

<p class="sig"><i>11th June, 1791.</i></p>

<p>Let me interest you, my dear Cunningham, in behalf of the gentleman
who waits on you with this. He is a Mr. Clarke, of Moffat, principal
schoolmaster there, and is at present suffering severely under the
persecution of one or two powerful individuals of his employers. He is
accused of harshness to boys that were placed under his care. God help
the teacher, if a man of sensibility and genius, and such is my friend
Clarke, when a booby father presents him with his booby son, and
insists on lighting up the rays of science, in a fellow&#8217;s head whose
skull is impervious and inaccessible by any other way than a positive
fracture with a cudgel: a fellow whom in fact it savours of impiety to
attempt making a scholar of, as he has been marked a blockhead in the
book of fate, at the almighty fiat of his Creator.</p>

<p>The patrons of Moffat-school are, the ministers, magistrates, and
town-council of Edinburgh, and as the business comes now before them,
let me beg my dearest friend to do everything in his power to serve
the interests of a man of genius and worth, and a man whom I
particularly respect and esteem. You know some good fellows among the
magistracy and council, but particularly you have much to say with a
reverend gentleman to whom you have the honour of being very nearly
related, and whom this country and age have had the honour to produce.
I need not name the historian of Charles V. I tell him through the
medium of his nephew&#8217;s influence, that Mr. Clarke is a gentleman who
will not disgrace even his patronage. I know the merits of the cause
thoroughly, and say it, that my friend is falling a sacrifice to
prejudiced ignorance.</p>

<p>God help the children of dependence! Hated and persecuted by their
enemies, and too often, alas! almost unexceptionably, received by
their friends with disrespect and reproach, under the thin disguise of
cold civility and humiliating advice. O! to be a sturdy savage,
stalking in the pride of his independence, amid the solitary wilds of
his deserts; rather than in civilized life, helplessly to tremble for
a subsistence, precarious as the caprice of a fellow-creature! Every
man has his virtues, and no man is without his failings; and curse on
that privileged plain-dealing of friendship, which, in the hour of my
calamity, cannot reach forth the helping hand without at the same time
pointing out those failings, and apportioning them their share in
procuring my present distress. My friends, for such the world calls
ye, and such ye think yourselves to be, pass by my virtues if you
please, but do, also, spare my follies: the first will witness in my
breast for themselves, and the last will give pain enough to the
ingenuous mind without you. And since deviating more or less from the
paths of propriety and rectitude, must be incident to human nature, do
thou, Fortune, put it in my power, always from myself, and of myself,
to bear the consequence of those errors! I do not want to be
independent that I may sin, but I want to be independent in my
sinning.</p>

<p>To return in this rambling letter to the subject I set out with, let
me recommend my friend, Mr. Clarke, to your acquaintance and good
offices; his worth entitles him to the one, and his gratitude will
merit the other. I long much to hear from you.</p>

what I much doubt I dare not venture on. I once already made a

stream.</p>

<p>Your lordship hints at an ode for the occasion: but who would write
after Collins? I read over his verses to the memory of Thomson, and
despaired.&mdash;I got indeed to the length of three or four stanzas, in
the way of address to the shade of the bard, on crowning his bust. I
shall trouble your lordship with the subjoined copy of them, which, I
am afraid, will be but too convincing a proof how unequal I am to the
task. However, it affords me an opportunity of approaching your
lordship, and declaring how sincerely and gratefully I have the honour

<p>Suspense is worse than disappointment, for that reason I hurry to tell
you that I just now learn that Mr. Ballantyne does not choose to
interfere more in the business. I am truly sorry for it, but cannot
help it.</p>

<p>You blame me for not writing you sooner, but you will please to
recollect that you omitted one little necessary piece of
information;&mdash;your address.</p>

<p>However, you know equally well, my hurried life, indolent temper, and
strength of attachment. It must be a longer period than the longest
life &#8220;in the world&#8217;s hale and undegenerate days,&#8221; that will make me
forget so dear a friend as Mr. Sloan. I am prodigal enough at times,
but I will not part with such a treasure as that.</p>

<p>I have nothing new to tell you. The few friends we have are going on
in the old way. I sold my crop on this day se&#8217;ennight, and sold it
very well. A guinea an acre, on an average, above value. But such a
scene of drunkenness was hardly ever seen in this country. After the
roup was over, about thirty people engaged in a battle, every man for
his own hand, and fought it out for three hours. Nor was the scene
much better in the house. No fighting, indeed, but folks lying drunk
on the floor, and decanting, until both my dogs got so drunk by
attending them, that they could not stand. You will easily guess how I
enjoyed the scene; as I was no farther over than you used to see me.</p>

<p>I would, as usual, have availed myself of the privilege your goodness
has allowed me, of sending you anything I compose in my poetical way;
but as I had resolved, so soon as the shock of my irreparable loss
would allow me, to pay a tribute to my late benefactor, I determined
to make that the first piece I should do myself the honour of sending
you. Had the wing of my fancy been equal to the ardour of my heart,
the enclosed had been much more worthy your perusal: as it is, I beg
leave to lay it at your ladyship&#8217;s feet. As all the world knows my
obligations to the late Earl of Glencairn, I would wish to show as
openly that my heart glows, and will ever glow, with the most grateful
sense and remembrance of his lordship&#8217;s goodness. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[439]</a></span> sables I did
myself the honour to wear to his lordship&#8217;s memory, were not the
&#8220;mockery of woe.&#8221; Nor shall my gratitude perish with me!&mdash;if among my
children I shall have a son that has a heart, he shall hand it down to
his child as a family honour, and a family debt, that my dearest
existence I owe to the noble house of Glencairn!</p>

<p>I was about to say, my lady, that if you think the poem may venture to
see the light, I would, in some way or other, give it to the world.</p>

unfinished from my listless tongue: at last I luckily thought of
reading over an old letter of yours, that lay by me in my book-case,
and I felt something for the first time since I opened my eyes, of

Law? Apropos, for connexion&#8217;s sake, do not address to me supervisor,

<p>I have just this minute got the frank, and next minute must send it to

that might have amused a vacant hour about as well as &#8220;Six excellent

adventitious advantages of princely connexions and princely fortune,
must yet, like the caterpillar, labour a whole lifetime before they

<h3>TO MISS DAVIES.</h3>

<p>[This accomplished lady was the youngest daughter of Dr. Davies, of
Tenby, in Pembrokeshire: she was related to the Riddels of Friar&#8217;s
Carse, and one of her sisters married Captain Adam Gordon, of the
noble family of Kenmure. She had both taste and skill in verse.]</p>

<p>It is impossible, Madam, that the generous warmth and angelic purity
of your youthful mind, can have any idea of that moral disease under
which I unhappily must rank us the chief of sinners; I mean a
torpitude of the moral powers, that may be called, a lethargy of
conscience. In vain Remorse rears her horrent crest, and rouses all
her snakes; beneath the deadly fixed eye and leaden hand of Indolence,
their wildest ire is charmed into the torpor of the bat, slumbering
out the rigours of winter, in the chink of a ruined wall. Nothing
less, Madam, could have made me so long neglect your obliging
commands. Indeed I had one apology&mdash;the bagatelle was not worth
presenting. Besides, so strongly am I interested in Miss Davies&#8217;s fate
and welfare in the serious business of life, amid its chances and
changes, that to make her the subject of a silly ballad is downright
mockery of these ardent feelings; &#8217;tis like an impertinent jest to a
dying friend.</p>

<p>Gracious Heaven! why this disparity between our wishes and our powers?
Why is the most generous wish to make others blest, impotent and
ineffectual&mdash;as the idle breeze that crosses the pathless desert! In
my walks of life I have met with a few people to whom how gladly would
I have said&mdash;&#8220;Go, be happy! I know that your hearts have been wounded
by the scorn of the proud, whom accident has placed above you&mdash;or
worse still, in whose hands are, perhaps, placed many of the comforts
of your life. But there! ascend that rock, Independence, and look
justly down on their littleness of soul. Make the worthless tremble
under your indignation, and the foolish sink before your contempt; and
largely impart that happiness to others, which, I am certain, will
give yourselves so much pleasure to bestow.&#8221;</p>

<p>Why, dear Madam, must I wake from this delightful revery, and find it
all a dream? Why, amid my generous enthusiasm, must I, find myself
poor and powerless, incapable of wiping one tear from the eye of pity,
or of adding one comfort to the friend I love!&mdash;Out upon the world,
say I, that its affairs are administered so ill! They talk of
reform;&mdash;good Heaven! what a reform would I make among the sons and
even the daughters of men!&mdash;Down, immediately, should go fools from
the high places, where misbegotten chance has perked them up, and
through life should they skulk, ever haunted by their native
insignificance, as the body marches accompanied by its shadow.&mdash;As for
a much more formidable class, the knaves, I am at a loss what to do
with them: had I a world, there should not be a knave in it.</p>

<p>But the hand that could give, I would liberally fill: and I would pour
delight on the heart that could kindly forgive, and generously love.</p>

<p>Still the inequalities of life are, among men, comparatively
tolerable&mdash;but there is a delicacy, a tenderness, accompanying every
view in which we can place lovely Woman, that are grated and shocked
at the rude, capricious distinctions of fortune. Woman is the
blood-royal of life: let there be slight degrees of precedency among
them&mdash;but let them be ALL sacred.&mdash;Whether this last sentiment be
right or wrong, I am not accountable; it is an original component
feature of my mind.</p>

<p>Many thanks to you, Madam, for your good news respecting the little
floweret and the mother-plant. I hope my poetic prayers have been
heard, and will be answered up to the warmest sincerity of their
fullest extent; and then Mrs. Henri will find her little darling the
representative of his late parent, in everything but his abridged
existence.</p>

<p>I have just finished the following song, which to a lady the
descendant of Wallace&mdash;and many heroes of his true illustrious
line&mdash;and herself the mother of several soldiers, needs neither
preface nor apology.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[441]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Scene</i>&mdash;<i>a field of battle</i>&mdash;<i>time of the day, evening;

<p>The circumstance that gave rise to the foregoing verses was, looking
over with a musical friend M&#8217;Donald&#8217;s collection of Highland airs, I
was struck with one, an Isle of Skye tune, entitled &#8220;Oran and Aoig,
or, The Song of Death,&#8221; to the measure of which I have adapted my
stanzas. I have of late composed two or three other little pieces,
which, ere yon full-orbed moon, whose broad impudent face now stares
at old mother earth all night, shall have shrunk into a modest
crescent, just peeping forth at dewy dawn, I shall find an hour to
transcribe for you. <i>A Dieu je vous commende.</i></p>

<p>[That the poet spoke mildly concerning the rebuke which he received

letter to Erskine of Mar sufficiently proves.]</p>

<p class="sig"><i>5th January, 1792.</i></p>

<p>You see my hurried life, Madam: I can only command starts of time;
however, I am glad of one thing; since I finished the other sheet, the
political blast that threatened my welfare is overblown. I have
corresponded with Commissioner Graham, for the board had made me the
subject of their animadversions; and now I have the pleasure of
informing you, that all is set to rights in that quarter. Now as to
these informers, may the devil be let loose to &mdash;&mdash; but, hold! I was
praying most fervently in my last sheet, and I must not so soon fall a
swearing in this.</p>

<p>Alas! how little do the wantonly or idly officious think what mischief
they do by their malicious insinuations, indirect impertinence, or
thoughtless blabbings. What a difference there is in intrinsic worth,
candour, benevolence, generosity, kindness,&mdash;in all the charities and
all the virtues, between one class of human beings and another! For
instance, the amiable circle I so lately mixed with in the hospitable
hall of Dunlop, their generous hearts&mdash;their uncontaminated dignified
minds&mdash;their informed and polished understandings&mdash;what a contrast,
when compared&mdash;if such comparing were not downright sacrilege&mdash;with
the soul of the miscreant who can deliberately plot the destruction of
an honest man that never offended him, and with a grin of satisfaction
see the unfortunate being, his faithful wife, and prattling innocents,
turned over to beggary and ruin!</p>

<p>Your cup, my dear Madam, arrived safe. I had two worthy fellows dining
with me the other day, when I, with great formality, produced my
whigmeeleerie cup, and told them that it had been a family-piece among
the descendants of William Wallace. This roused such an enthusiasm,
that they insisted on bumpering the punch round in it; and by and by,
never did your great ancestor lay a <i>Suthron</i> more completely to rest,
than for a time did your cup my two friends. Apropos, this is the
season of wishing. My God bless you, my dear friend, and bless me, the
humblest and sincerest of your friends, by granting you yet many
returns of the season! May all good things attend you and yours
wherever they are scattered over the earth!</p>

<h4>PRINTER.</h4>

<p>[When Burns sends his warmest wishes to Smellie, and prays that

<p class="sig"><i>Dumfries, 22d January, 1792.</i></p>

<p>I sit down, my dear Sir, to introduce a young lady to you, and a lady
in the first ranks of fashion too. What a task! to you&mdash;who care no
more for the herd of animals called young ladies, than you do for the
herd of animals called young gentlemen. To you&mdash;who despise and detest
the groupings and combinations of fashion,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[442]</a></span> as an idiot painter that
seems industrious to place staring fools and unprincipled knaves in
the foreground of his picture, while men of sense and honesty are too
often thrown in the dimmest shades. Mrs. Riddel, who will take this
letter to town with her, and send it to you, is a character that, even
in your own way, as a naturalist and a philosopher, would be an
acquisition to your acquaintance. The lady, too, is a votary to the
muses; and as I think myself somewhat of a judge in my own trade, I
assure you that her verses, always correct, and often elegant, are
much beyond the common run of the <i>lady-poetesses</i> of the day. She is
a great admirer of your book; and, hearing me say that I was
acquainted with you, she begged to be known to you, as she is just
going to pay her first visit to our Caledonian capital. I told her
that her best way was, to desire her near relation, and your intimate
friend, Craigdarroch, to have you at his house while she was there;
and lest you might think of a lively West Indian girl, of eighteen, as
girls of eighteen too often deserve to be thought of, I should take
care to remove that prejudice. To be impartial, however, in
appreciating the lady&#8217;s merits, she has one unlucky failing: a failing
which you will easily discover, as she seems rather pleased with
indulging in it; and a failing that you will easily pardon, as it is a
sin which very much besets yourself;&mdash;where she dislikes, or despises,
she is apt to make no more a secret of it, than where she esteems and
respects.</p>

<p>I will not present you with the unmeaning <i>compliments of the season</i>,
but I will send you my warmest wishes and most ardent prayers, that
Fortune may never throw your subsistence to the mercy of a Knave, or
set your character on the judgment of a Fool; but that, upright and
erect, you may walk to an honest grave, where men of letters shall
say, here lies a man who did honour to science, and men of worth shall
say, here lies a man who did honour to human nature.</p>

indebted to thy supereminent goodness, that from the luminous path of
thy own right-lined rectitude, thou lookest benignly down on an erring
wretch, of whom the zig-zag wanderings defy all the powers of
calculation, from the simple copulation of units, up to the hidden
mysteries of fluxions! May one feeble ray of that light of wisdom
which darts from thy sensorium, straight as the arrow of heaven, and

iron-barred lucerne of a pestiferous dungeon, to the cloudless glory
of a summer sun! Sorely sighing in bitterness of soul, I say, when
shall my name be the quotation of the wise, and my countenance be the

understanding, purged from sensual appetites and gross desires, shine
like the constellation of thy intellectual powers!&mdash;As for thee, thy
thoughts are pure, and thy lips are holy. Never did the unhallowed
breath of the powers of darkness, and the pleasures of darkness,
pollute the sacred flame of thy sky-descended and heaven-bound
desires: never did the vapours of impurity stain the unclouded serene
of thy cerulean imagination. O that like thine were the tenor of my
life, like thine the tenor of my conversation! then should no friend
fear for my strength, no enemy rejoice in my weakness! Then should I
lie down and rise up, and none to make me afraid.&mdash;May thy pity and
thy prayer be exercised for, O thou lamp of wisdom and mirror of
morality! thy devoted slave.</p>

some repairs on them at a neighbouring smithy. His way lay by the kirk
of Alloway, and being rather on the anxious look-out in approaching a
place so well known to be a favourite haunt of the devil and the
devil&#8217;s friends and emissaries, he was struck aghast by discovering
through the horrors of the storm and stormy night, a light, which on
his nearer approach plainly showed itself to proceed from the haunted
edifice. Whether he had been fortified from above, on his devout
supplication, as is customary with people when they suspect the
immediate presence of Satan; or whether, according to another custom,
he had got courageously drunk at the smithy, I will not pretend to
determine; but so it was that he ventured to go up to, nay, into, the
very kirk. As luck would have it, his temerity came off unpunished.</p>

<p>The members of the infernal junto were all out on some midnight
business or other, and he saw nothing but a kind of kettle or caldron,
depending from the roof, over the fire, simmering some heads of
unchristened children, limbs of executed malefactors, &amp;c., for the
business of the night.&mdash;It was in for a penny in for a pound, with the
honest ploughman: so without ceremony he unhooked the caldron from off
the fire, and pouring out the damnable ingredients, inverted it on his
head, and carried it fairly home, where it remained long in the
family, a living evidence of the truth of the story.</p>

<p>Another story, which I can prove to be equally authentic, was as
follows:</p>

<p>On a market day in the town of Ayr, a farmer from Carrick, and
consequently whose way lay by the very gate of Alloway kirk-yard, in
order to cross the river Doon at the old bridge, which is about two or
three hundred yards farther on than the said gate, had been detained
by his business, till by the time he reached Alloway it was the wizard
hour, between night and morning.</p>

<p>Though he was terrified with a blaze stream<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[444]</a></span>ing from the kirk, yet it
is a well-known fact that to turn back on these occasions is running
by far the greatest risk of mischief, he prudently advanced on his
road. When he had reached the gate of the kirk-yard, he was surprised
and entertained, through the ribs and arches of an old gothic window,
which still faces the highway, to see a dance of witches merrily
footing it round their old sooty blackguard master, who was keeping
them all alive with the power of his bag-pipe. The farmer stopping his
horse to observe them a little, could plainly descry the faces of many
old women of his acquaintance and neighbourhood. How the gentleman was
dressed tradition does not say; but that the ladies were all in their
smocks: and one of them happening unluckily to have a smock which was
considerably too short to answer all the purpose of that piece of
dress, our farmer was so tickled, that he involuntarily burst out,
with a loud laugh, &#8220;Weel luppen, Maggy wi&#8217; the short sark!&#8221; and
recollecting himself, instantly spurred his horse to the top of his
speed. I need not mention the universally known fact, that no
diabolical power can pursue you beyond the middle of a running stream.
Lucky it was for the poor farmer that the river Doon was so near, for
notwithstanding the speed of his horse, which was a good one, against
he reached the middle of the arch of the bridge, and consequently the
middle of the stream, the pursuing, vengeful hags, were so close at
big heels, that one of them actually sprung to seize him; but it was
too late, nothing was on her side of the stream, but the horse&#8217;s tail,
which immediately gave way at her infernal grip, as if blasted by a
stroke of lightning; but the farmer was beyond her reach. However, the
unsightly, tailless condition of the vigorous steed was, to the last
hour of the noble creature&#8217;s life, an awful warning to the Carrick
farmers, not to stay too late in Ayr markets.</p>

<p>The last relation I shall give, though equally true, is not so well
identified as the two former, with regard to the scene; but as the
best authorities give it for Alloway, I shall relate it.</p>

<p>On a summer&#8217;s evening, about the time that nature puts on her sables
to mourn the expiry of the cheerful day, a shepherd boy, belonging to
a farmer in the immediate neighbourhood of Alloway kirk, had just
folded his charge, and was returning home. As he passed the kirk, in
the adjoining field, he fell in with a crew of men and women, who were
busy pulling stems of the plant Ragwort. He observed that as each
person pulled a Ragwort, he or she got astride of it, and called out,
&#8220;Up horsie!&#8221; on which the Ragwort flew off, like Pegasus, through the
air with its rider. The foolish boy likewise pulled his Ragwort, and
cried with the rest, &#8220;Up horsie!&#8221; and, strange to tell, away he flew
with the company. The first stage at which the cavalcade stopt, was a
merchant&#8217;s wine-cellar in Bordeaux, where, without saying by your
leave, they quaffed away at the best the cellar could afford, until
the morning, foe to the imps and works of darkness, threatened to
throw light on the matter, and frightened them from their carousals.</p>

<p>The poor shepherd lad, being equally a stranger to the scene and the
liquor, heedlessly got himself drunk; and when the rest took horse, he
fell asleep, and was found so next day by some of the people belonging
to the merchant. Somebody that understood Scotch, asking him what he
was, he said such-a-one&#8217;s herd in Alloway, and by some means or other
getting home again, he lived long to tell the world the wondrous tale.</p>

<p>Mr. Burns begs leave to present his most respectful compliments to Mr.
Clarke.&mdash;Mr. B. some time ago did himself the honour of writing to Mr.
C. respecting coming out to the country, to give a little musical
instruction in a highly respectable family, where Mr. C. may have his
own terms, and may be as happy as indolence, the devil, and the gout
will permit him. Mr. B. knows well how Mr. C. is engaged with another
family; but cannot Mr. C. find two or three weeks to spare to each of
them? Mr. B. is deeply impressed with, and awfully conscious of, the
high importance of Mr. C.&#8217;s time, whether in the winged moments of
symphonious exhibition, at the keys of harmony, while listening
seraphs cease their own less de<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[445]</a></span>lightful strains; or in the drowsy
arms of slumb&#8217;rous repose, in the arms of his dearly beloved
elbowchair, where the frowsy, but potent power of indolence,
circumfuses her vapours round, and sheds her dews on the head of her
darling son. But half a line conveying half a meaning from Mr. C.
would make Mr. B. the happiest of mortals.</p>

<p>[To enthusiastic fits of admiration for the young and the beautiful,
such as Burns has expressed in this letter, he loved to give way:&mdash;we
owe some of his best songs to these sallies.]</p>

<p class="sig"><i>Annan Water Foot, 22d August, 1792.</i></p>

<p>Do not blame me for it, Madam;&mdash;my own conscience, hackneyed and
weather-beaten as it is in watching and reproving my vagaries,
follies, indolence, &amp;c., has continued to punish me sufficiently.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Do you think it possible, my dear and honoured friend, that I could be
so lost to gratitude for many favours; to esteem for much worth, and
to the honest, kind, pleasurably tie of, now old acquaintance, and I
hope and am sure of progressive, increasing friendship&mdash;as for a
single day, not to think of you&mdash;to ask the Fates what they are doing
and about to do with my much-loved friend and her wide-scattered
connexions, and to beg of them to be as kind to you and yours as they
possibly can?</p>

<p>Apropos! (though how it is apropos, I have not leisure to explain,) do
you not know that I am almost in love with an acquaintance of
yours?&mdash;Almost! said I&mdash;I am in love, souse! over head and ears, deep
as the most unfathomable abyss of the boundless ocean; but the word
Love, owing to the <i>intermingledoms</i> of the good and the bad, the pure
and the impure, in this world, being rather an equivocal term for
expressing one&#8217;s sentiments and sensations, I must do justice to the
sacred purity of my attachment. Know, then, that the heart-struck awe;
the distant humble approach; the delight we should have in gazing upon
and listening to a messenger of heaven, appearing in all the unspotted
purity of his celestial home, among the coarse, polluted, far inferior
sons of men, to deliver to them tidings that make their hearts swim in
joy, and their imaginations soar in transport&mdash;such, so delighting and
so pure, were the emotions of my soul on meeting the other day with
Miss Lesley Baillie, your neighbour, at M&mdash;&mdash;. Mr. B. with his two
daughters, accompanied by Mr. H. of G. passing through Dumfries a few
days ago, on their way to England, did me the honour of calling on me;
on which I took my horse (though God knows I could ill spare the
time), and accompanied them fourteen or fifteen miles, and dined and
spent the day with them. &#8217;Twas about nine, I think, when I left them,
and riding home, I composed the following ballad, of which you will
probably think you have a dear bargain, as it will cost you another
groat of postage. You must know that there is an old ballad beginning
with&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;My bonnie Lizzie Baillie<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I&#8217;ll rowe thee in my plaidie, &amp;c.&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>So I parodied it as follows, which is literally the first copy,
&#8220;unanointed, unanneal&#8217;d;&#8221; as Hamlet says.&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p>So much for ballads. I regret that you are gone to the east country,
as I am to be in Ayrshire in about a fortnight. This world of ours,
notwithstanding it has many good things in it, yet it has ever had
this curse, that two or three people, who would be the happier the
oftener they met together, are, almost without exception, always so
placed as never to meet but once or twice a-year, which, considering
the few years of a man&#8217;s life, is a very great &#8220;evil under the sun,&#8221;
which I do not recollect that Solomon has mentioned in his catalogue
of the miseries of man. I hope and believe that there is a state of
existence beyond the grave, where the worthy of this life will renew
their former intimacies, with this endearing addition, that, &#8220;we meet
to part no more!&#8221;</p>

<p>[There is both bitterness and humour in this letter: the poet
discourses on many matters, and woman is among them&mdash;but he places the
bottle at his elbow as an antidote against the discourtesy of
scandal.]</p>

<p class="sig"><i>Dumfries, 10th September, 1792.</i></p>

<p>No! I will not attempt an apology.&mdash;Amid all my hurry of business,
grinding the faces of the publican and the sinner on the merciless
wheels of the Excise; making ballads, and then drinking, and singing
them! and, over and above all, the correcting the press-work of two
different publications; still, still I might have stolen five minutes
to dedicate to one of the first of my friends and fellow-creatures. I
might have done as I do at present, snatched an hour near &#8220;witching
time of night,&#8221; and scrawled a page or two. I might have congratulated
my friend on his marriage; or I might have thanked the Caledonian
archers for the honour they have done me (though, to do myself
justice, I intended to have done both in rhyme, else I had done both
long ere now). Well, then, here&#8217;s to your good health! for you must
know, I have set a nipperkin of toddy by me, just by way of spell, to
keep away the meikle horned deil, or any of his subaltern imps who may
be on their nightly rounds.</p>

<p>But what shall I write to you?&mdash;&#8220;The voice said cry,&#8221; and I said,
&#8220;what shall I cry?&#8221;&mdash;O, thou spirit! whatever thou art, or wherever
thou makest thyself visible! be thou a bogle by the eerie side of an
auld thorn, in the dreary glen through which the herd-callan maun
bicker in his gloamin route frae the faulde!&mdash;Be thou a brownie, set,
at dead of night, to thy task by the blazing ingle, or in the solitary
barn, where the repercussions of thy iron flail half affright thyself
as thou performest the work of twenty of the sons of men, ere the
cock-crowing summon thee to thy ample cog of substantial brose&mdash;Be
thou a kelpie, haunting the ford or ferry, in the starless night,
mixing thy laughing yell with the howling of the storm and the roaring
of the flood, as thou viewest the perils and miseries of man on the
foundering horse, or in the tumbling boat!&mdash;or, lastly, be thou a
ghost, paying thy nocturnal visits to the hoary ruins of decayed
grandeur; or performing thy mystic rites in the shadow of the
time-worn church, while the moon looks, without a cloud, on the silent
ghastly dwellings of the dead around thee! or taking thy stand by the
bedside of the villain, or the murderer, pourtraying on his dreaming
fancy, pictures, dreadful as the horrors of unveiled hell, and
terrible as the wrath of incensed Deity!&mdash;Come, thou spirit, but not
in these horrid forms; come with the milder, gentle, easy
inspirations, which thou breathest round the wig of a prating
advocate, or the t&ecirc;te of a tea-sipping gossip, while their tongues run
at the light-horse gallop of clishmaclaver for ever and ever&mdash;come
and assist a poor devil who is quite jaded in the attempt to share
half an idea among half a hundred words; to fill up four quarto pages,
while he has not got one single sentence of recollection, information,
or remark worth putting pen to paper for.</p>

<p>I feel, I feel the presence of supernatural assistance! circled in the
embrace of my elbowchair, my breast labours, like the bloated Sybil on
her three-footed stool, and like her, too, labours with
Nonsense.&mdash;Nonsense, suspicious name! Tutor, friend, and finger-post
in the mystic mazes of law; the cadaverous paths of physic; and
particularly in the sightless soarings of <span class="smcap">school divinity</span>,
who, leaving Common Sense confounded at his strength of pinion,
Reason, delirious with eyeing his giddy flight; and Truth creeping
back into the bottom of her well, cursing the hour that ever she
offered her scorned alliance to the wizard power of Theologic
Vision&mdash;raves abroad on all the winds. &#8220;On earth Discord! a gloomy
Heaven above, opening her jealous gates to the nineteenth thousandth
part of the tithe of mankind; and below, an inescapable and inexorable
hell, expanding its leviathan jaws for the vast residue of
mortals!!!&#8221;&mdash;O doctrine! comfortable and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[447]</a></span> healing to the weary,
wounded soul of man! Ye sons and daughters of affliction, ye <i>pauvres
miserables</i>, to whom day brings no pleasure, and night yields no rest,
be comforted! &#8220;&#8217;Tis but <i>one</i> to nineteen hundred thousand that your
situation will mend in this world;&#8221; so, alas, the experience of the
poor and the needy too often affirms; and &#8217;tis nineteen hundred
thousand sand to <i>one</i>, by the dogmas of * * * * * * * * that you will be damned
eternally in the world to come!</p>

<p>But of all nonsense, religious nonsense is the most nonsensical; so
enough, and more than enough of it. Only, by the by, will you or can
you tell me, my dear Cunningham, why a sectarian turn of mind has
always a tendency to narrow and illiberalize the heart? They are
orderly; they may be just; nay, I have known them merciful: but still
your children of sanctity move among their fellow-creatures with a
nostril-snuffing putrescence, and a foot-spurning filth, in short,
with a conceited dignity that your titled * * * * * * * * or any other of your
Scottish lordlings of seven centuries standing, display when they
accidentally mix among the many-aproned sons of mechanical life. I
remember, in my plough-boy days, I could not conceive it possible that
a noble lord could be a fool, or a godly man could be a knave&mdash;How
ignorant are plough-boys!&mdash;Nay, I have since discovered that a <i>godly
woman</i> may be a *****!&mdash;But hold&mdash;Here&#8217;s t&#8217;ye again&mdash;this rum is
generous Antigua, so a very unfit menstruum for scandal.</p>

<p>Apropos, how do you like, I mean <i>really</i> like, the married life? Ah,
my friend! matrimony is quite a different thing from what your
love-sick youths and sighing girls take it to be! But marriage, we are
told, is appointed by God, and I shall never quarrel with any of his
institutions. I am a husband of older standing than you, and shall
give you <i>my</i> ideas of the conjugal state, (<i>en passant</i>; you know I
am no Latinist, is not <i>conjugal</i> derived from <i>jugum</i>, a yoke?) Well,
then, the scale of good wifeship I divide into ten
parts:&mdash;good-nature, four; good sense, two; wit, one; personal charms,
viz. a sweet face, eloquent eyes, fine limbs, graceful carriage (I
would add a fine waist too, but that is so soon spoilt you know), all
these, one; as for the other qualities belonging to, or attending on,
a wife, such as fortune, connexions, education (I mean education
extraordinary) family, blood, &amp;c., divide the two remaining degrees
among them as you please; only, remember that all these minor
properties must be expressed by <i>fractions</i>, for there is not any one
of them, in the aforesaid scale, entitled to the dignity of an
<i>integer.</i></p>

<p>As for the rest of my fancies and reveries&mdash;how I lately met with Miss
Lesley Baillie, the most beautiful, elegant woman in the world&mdash;how I
accompanied her and her father&#8217;s family fifteen miles on their
journey, out of pure devotion, to admire the loveliness of the works
of God, in such an unequalled display of them&mdash;how, in galloping home
at night, I made a ballad on her, of which these two stanzas make a
part&mdash;</p>

imaginations, and shall be read by thee, my dear friend, and by thy
beloved spouse, my other dear friend, at a more convenient season.</p>

<p>Now, to thee, and to thy before-designed <i>bosom</i>-companion, be given

Only, don&#8217;t hurry me&mdash;&#8220;Deil tak the hindmost&#8221; is by no means the <i>cri

enthusiastic attachment to the poetry and music of old Caledonia, and,
since you request it, have cheerfully promised my mite of
assistance&mdash;will you let me have a list of your airs with the first
line of the printed verses you intend for them, that I may have an
opportunity of suggesting any alteration that may occur to me? You
know &#8217;tis in the way of my trade; still leaving you, gentlemen, the
undoubted right of publishers to approve or reject, at your pleasure,
for your own publication. Apropos, if you are for English verses,
there is, on my part, an end of the matter. Whether in the simplicity
of the Ballad, or the pathos of the song, I can only hope to please
myself in being allowed at least a sprinkling of our native tongue.
English verses, particularly the works of Scotsmen, that have merit,
are certainly very eligible. &#8220;Tweedside&#8217;&#8221; &#8220;Ah! the poor shepherd&#8217;s

&amp;c., usually set to &#8220;The Mill, Mill, O!&#8221; is a disgrace to the
collections in which it has already appeared, and would doubly
disgrace a collection that will have the very superior merit of yours.
But more of this in the further prosecution of the business, if I am
called on for my strictures and amendments&mdash;I say amendments, for I
will not alter except where I myself, at least, think that I amend.</p>

<p>As to any remuneration, you may think my songs either above or below
price; for they should absolutely be the one or the other. In the
honest enthusiasm with which I embark in your undertaking, to talk of
money, wages, fee, hire, &amp;c., would be downright prostitution of soul!
a proof of each of the song that I compose or amend, I shall receive
as a favour. In the rustic phrase of the season, &#8220;Gude speed the

convulsed with every horror that can harrow the human
feelings&mdash;sick&mdash;looking, longing for a comforter, but finding none&mdash;a
mother&#8217;s feelings, too:&mdash;but it is too much: he who wounded (he only
can) may He heal!</p>

<p>I wish the farmer great joy of his new acquisition to his family. * * * * *
I cannot say that I give him joy of his life as a farmer. &#8217;Tis, as a
farmer paying a dear, unconscionable rent, a <i>cursed life</i>! As to a
laird farming his own property; sowing his own corn in hope; and
reaping it, in spite of brittle weather, in gladness; knowing that
none can say unto him, &#8216;what dost thou?&#8217;&mdash;fattening his herds;
shearing his flocks; rejoicing at Christmas; and begetting sons and
daughters, until he be the venerated, gray-haired leader of a little
tribe&mdash;&#8217;tis a heavenly life! but devil take the life of reaping the
fruits that another must eat.</p>

<p>Well, your kind wishes will be gratified, as to seeing me when I make
my Ayrshire visit. I cannot leave Mrs. B&mdash;&mdash;, until her nine months&#8217;
race is run, which may perhaps be in three or four weeks. She, too,
seems determined to make me the patriarchal leader of a band. However,
if Heaven will be so obliging as to let me have them in the proportion
of three boys to one girl, I shall be so much the more pleased. I
hope, if I am spared with them, to show a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[449]</a></span> set of boys that will do
honour to my cares and name; but I am not equal to the task of rearing
girls. Besides, I am too poor; a girl should always have a fortune.
Apropos, your little godson is thriving charmingly, but is a very
devil. He, though two years younger, has completely mastered his
brother. Robert is indeed the mildest, gentlest creature I ever saw.
He has a most surprising memory, and is quite the pride of his
schoolmaster.</p>

<p>You know how readily we get into prattle upon a subject dear to our
heart: you can excuse it. God bless you and yours!</p>

<p>[This letter has no date: it is supposed to have been written on the
death of her daughter, Mrs. Henri, whose orphan son, deprived of the
protection of all his relations, was preserved by the affectionate
kindness of Mademoiselle Susette, one of the family domestics, and
after the Revolution obtained the estate of his blood and name.]</p>

<p>I had been from home, and did not receive your letter until my return
the other day. What shall I say to comfort you, my much-valued,
much-afflicted friend! I can but grieve with you; consolation I have
none to offer, except that which religion holds out to the children of
affliction&mdash;<i>children of affliction!</i>&mdash;how just the expression! and
like every other family they have matters among them which they hear,
see, and feel in a serious, all-important manner, of which the world
has not, nor cares to have, any idea. The world looks indifferently
on, makes the passing remark, and proceeds to the next novel
occurrence.</p>

<p>Alas, Madam! who would wish for many years? What is it but to drag
existence until our joys gradually expire, and leave us in a night of
misery: like the gloom which blots out the stars one by one, from the

<p>[Thomson had delivered judgment on some old Scottish songs, but the

<p class="sig7"><span class="smcap">My Dear Sir</span>,</p>

<p>Let me tell you, that you are too fastidious in your ideas of songs
and ballads. I own that your criticisms are just; the songs you
specify in your list have, all but one, the faults you remark in them;
but who shall mend the matter? Who shall rise up and say, &#8220;Go to! I
will make a better?&#8221; For instance, on reading over &#8220;The Lea-rig,&#8221; I
immediately set about trying my hand on it, and, after all, I could
make nothing more of it than the following, which, Heaven knows, is
poor enough.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">When o&#8217;er the hill the eastern star, &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Your observation as to the aptitude of Dr. Percy&#8217;s ballad to the air,
&#8220;Nannie, O!&#8221; is just. It is, besides, perhaps, the most beautiful
ballad in the English language. But let me remark to you, that in the
sentiment and style of our Scottish airs, there is a pastoral
simplicity, a something that one may call the Doric style and dialect
of vocal music, to which a dash of our native tongue and manners is
particularly, nay peculiarly, apposite. For this reason, and upon my
honour, for this reason alone, I am of opinion (but, as I told you
before, my opinion is yours, freely yours, to approve or reject, as
you please) that my ballad of &#8220;Nannie, O!&#8221; might perhaps do for one
set of verses to the tune. Now don&#8217;t let it enter into your head, that
you are under any necessity of taking my verses. I have long ago made
up my mind as to my own reputation in the business of authorship, and
have nothing to be pleased or offended at, in your adoption or
rejection of my verses. Though you should reject one half of what I
give you, I shall be pleased with your adopting the other half, and
shall continue to serve you with the same assiduity.</p>

<p>In the printed copy of my &#8220;Nannie, O!&#8221; the name of the river is
horribly prosaic.<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> I will alter it:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Behind yon hills where Lugar flows.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Girvan is the name of the river that suits the idea of the stanza
best, but Lugar is the most agreeable modulation of syllables.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[450]</a></span></p>
<p>I will soon give you a great many more remarks on this business; but I
have just now an opportunity of conveying you this scrawl, free of
postage, an expense that it is ill able to pay: so, with my best
compliments to honest Allan, Gude be wi&#8217; ye, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="sig7"><i>Friday Night.</i></p>

<p class="sig"><i>Saturday Morning.</i></p>

<p>As I find I have still an hour to spare this morning before my
conveyance goes away, I will give you &#8220;Nannie, O!&#8221; at length.</p>

<p>Your remarks on &#8220;Ewe-bughts, Marion,&#8221; are just; still it has obtained
a place among our more classical Scottish songs; and what with many
beauties in its composition, and more prejudices in its favour, you
will not find it easy to supplant it.</p>

<p>In my very early years, when I was thinking of going to the West
Indies, I took the following farewell of a dear girl. It is quite
trifling, and has nothing of the merits of &#8220;Ewe-bughts;&#8221; but it will
fill up this page. You must know that all my earlier love-songs were
the breathings of ardent passion, and though it might have been easy
in aftertimes to have given them a polish, yet that polish, to me,
whose they were, and who perhaps alone cared for them, would have
defaced the legend of my heart, which was so faithfully inscribed on
them. Their uncouth simplicity was, as they say of wines, their race.</p>

criticisms with equal frankness. My wish is not to stand aloof, the

<p>If you mean, my dear Sir, that all the songs in your collection shall
be poetry of the first merit, I am afraid you will find more
difficulty in the undertaking than you are aware of. There is a
peculiar rhythmus in many of our airs, and a necessity of adapting
syllables to the emphasis, or what I would call the feature-notes of
the tune, that cramp the poet, and lay him under almost insuperable
difficulties. For instance, in the air, &#8220;My wife&#8217;s a wanton wee
thing,&#8221; if a few lines smooth and pretty can be adapted to it, it is
all you can expect. The following were made extempore to it; and
though on further study I might give you something more profound, yet
it might not suit the light-horse gallop of the air so well as this
random clink:&mdash;</p>

the following rhapsody, which I composed the other day, on a charming
Ayrshire girl, Miss Lesley Baillie, as she passed through this place
to England, will suit your taste better than the &#8220;Collier Lassie,&#8221;

<h3>TO MR. THOMSON.</h3>

<p>[The story of Mary Campbell&#8217;s love is related in the notes on the
songs which the poet wrote in her honour. Thomson says, in his answer,
&#8220;I have heard the sad story of your Mary; you always seem inspired
when you write of her.&#8221;]</p>

<p class="sig"><i>14th November, 1792.</i></p>

<p class="sig7"><span class="smcap">My Dear Sir</span>,</p>

<p>I agree with you that the song, &#8220;Katherine Ogie,&#8221; is very poor stuff,
and unworthy, altogether unworthy of so beautiful an air. I tried to
mend it; but the awkward sound, Ogie, recurring so often in the rhyme,
spoils every attempt at introducing sentiment into the piece. The
foregoing song<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a> pleases myself; I think it <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[451]</a></span> as in my happiest manner: you will see at first glance that it suits
the air. The subject of the song is one of the most interesting
passages of my youthful days, and I own that I should be much
flattered to see the verses set to an air which would ensure
celebrity. Perhaps, after all, &#8217;tis the still glowing prejudice of my
heart that throws a borrowed lustre over the merits of the
composition.</p>

<p>I have partly taken your idea of &#8220;Auld Rob Morris.&#8221; I have adopted the
two first verses, and am going on with the song on a new plan, which
promises pretty well. I take up one or another, just as the bee of the
moment buzzes in my bonnet-lug; and do you, <i>sans ceremonie</i>, make
what use you choose of the productions.</p>

refused, however, to adopt others, where he thought too much of the
sense was sacrificed.]</p>

<p class="sig"><i>Dumfries, 1st December, 1792.</i></p>

<p>Your alterations of my &#8220;Nannie, O!&#8221; are perfectly right. So are those
of &#8220;My wife&#8217;s a winsome wee thing.&#8221; Your alteration of the second
stanza is a positive improvement. Now, my dear Sir, with the freedom
which characterizes our correspondence, I must not, cannot alter
&#8220;Bonnie Lesley.&#8221; You are right; the word &#8220;Alexander&#8221; makes the line a
little uncouth, but I think the thought is pretty. Of Alexander,
beyond all other heroes, it may be said, in the sublime language of
Scripture, that &#8220;he went forth conquering and to conquer.&#8221;</p>

<p>This is, in my opinion, more poetical than &#8220;Ne&#8217;er made sic anither.&#8221;
However, it is immaterial: make it either way. &#8220;Caledonie,&#8221; I agree
with you, is not so good a word as could be wished, though it is
sanctioned in three or four instances by Allan Ramsay; but I cannot
help it. In short, that species of stanza is the most difficult that I
have ever tried.</p>

<p>I shall be in Ayrshire, I think, next week; and, if at all possible, I
shall certainly, my much-esteemed friend, have the pleasure of
visiting at Dunlop-house.</p>

<p>Alas, Madam! how seldom do we meet in this world, that we have reason
to congratulate ourselves on accessions of happiness! I have not
passed half the ordinary term of an old man&#8217;s life, and yet I scarcely
look over the obituary of a newspaper, that I do not see some names
that I have known, and which I, and other acquaintances, little
thought to meet with there so soon. Every other instance of the
mortality of our kind, makes us cast an anxious look into the dreadful
abyss of uncertainty, and shudder with apprehension for our own fate.
But of how different an importance are the lives of different
individuals? Nay, of what importance is one period of the same life,
more than another? A few years ago, I could have laid down in the
dust, &#8220;careless of the voice of the morning;&#8221; and now not a few, and
these most helpless individuals, would, on losing me and my exertions,
lose both their &#8220;staff and shield.&#8221; By the way, these helpless ones
have lately got an addition; Mrs. B&mdash;&mdash; having given me a fine girl

<span class="i0">&#8220;The valiant <i>in himself</i>, what can he suffer?<br /></span>

<p>I do not remember to have heard you mention Thomson&#8217;s dramas. I pick
up favourite quotations, and store them in my mind as ready armour,
offensive or defensive, amid the struggle of this turbulent existence.
Of these is one, a very favourite one, from his &#8220;Alfred:&#8221;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;Attach thee firmly to the virtuous deeds<br /></span>

<span class="i0">With all its vain and transient joys, sit loose.&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Probably I have quoted some of these to you formerly, as indeed when I
write from the heart, I am apt to be guilty of such repetitions. The
compass of the heart, in the musical style of expression, is much more
bounded than that of the imagination; so the notes of the former are
extremely apt to run into one another; but in return for the paucity
of its compass, its few notes are much more sweet. I must still give
you another quotation, which I am almost sure I have given you before,
but I cannot resist the temptation. The subject is religion&mdash;speaking
of its importance to mankind, the author says,</p>

courage, and wither resolution<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[453]</a></span>! To your patronage, as a man of some
genius, you have allowed me a claim; and your esteem, as an honest

may I adjure you to save me from that misery which threatens to
overwhelm me, and which, with my latest breath I will say it, I have
not deserved.</p>

<p>[Burns was ordered, he says, to mind his duties in the Excise, and to
hold his tongue about politics&mdash;the latter part of the injunction was
hard to obey, for at that time politics were in every mouth.]</p>

<p class="sig"><i>Dumfries, 31st December, 1792.</i></p>

<p class="sig7"><span class="smcap">Dear Madam</span>,</p>

<p>A hurry of business, thrown in heaps by my absence, has until now
prevented my returning my grateful acknowledgments to the good family
of Dunlop, and you in particular, for that hospitable kindness which
rendered the four days I spent under that genial roof, four of the
pleasantest I ever enjoyed.&mdash;Alas, my dearest friend! how few and
fleeting are those things we call pleasures! on my road to Ayrshire, I
spent a night with a friend whom I much valued; a man whose days
promised to be many; and on Saturday last we laid him in the dust!</p>

<p class="sig"><i>Jan. 2, 1793.</i></p>

<p>I have just received yours of the 30th, and feel much for your
situation. However, I heartily rejoice in your prospect of recovery
from that vile jaundice. As to myself, I am better, though not quite
free of my complaint.&mdash;You must not think, as you seem to insinuate,
that in my way of life I want exercise. Of that I have enough; but
occasional hard drinking is the devil to me. Against this I have again
and again bent my resolution, and have greatly succeeded. Taverns I
have totally abandoned: it is the private parties in the family way,
among the hard-drinking gentlemen of this country, that do me the
mischief&mdash;but even this I have more than half given over.</p>

<p>Mr. Corbet can be of little service to me at present; at least I
should be shy of applying. I cannot possibly be settled as a
supervisor, for several years. I must wait the rotation of the list,
and there are twenty names before mine. I might indeed get a job of
officiating, where a settled supervisor was ill, or aged; but that
hauls me from my family, as I could not remove them on such an
uncertainty. Besides, some envious, malicious devil, has raised a
little demur on my political principles, and I wish to let that matter
settle before I offer myself too much in the eye of my supervisors. I
have set, henceforth, a seal on my lips, as to these unlucky politics;
but to you I must breathe my sentiments. In this, as in everything
else, I shall show the undisguised emotions of my soul. War I
deprecate: misery and ruin to thousands are in the blast that
announces the destructive demon.</p>

<h3>TO MR. THOMSON.</h3>

<p>[Thomson explained more fully than at first the plan of his
publication, and stated that Dr. Beattie had promised an essay on
Scottish music, by way of an introduction to the work.]</p>

<p class="sig"><i>26th January, 1793.</i></p>

<p>I approve greatly, my dear Sir, of your plans. Dr. Beattie&#8217;s essay
will, of itself, be a treasure. On my part I mean to draw up an
appendix to the Doctor&#8217;s essay, containing my stock of anecdotes, &amp;c.,
of our Scots songs. All the late Mr.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[454]</a></span> Tytler&#8217;s anecdotes I have by me,
taken down in the course of my acquaintance with him, from his own
mouth. I am such an enthusiast, that in the course of my several
peregrinations through Scotland, I made a pilgrimage to the individual
spot from which every song took its rise, &#8220;Lochaber&#8221; and the &#8220;Braes of
Ballenden&#8221; excepted. So far as the locality, either from the title of
the air, or the tenor of the song, could be ascertained, I have paid
my devotions at the particular shrine of every Scots muse.</p>

<p>I do not doubt but you might make a very valuable collection of
Jacobite songs; but would it give no offence? In the meantime, do not
you think that some of them, particularly &#8220;The sow&#8217;s tail to Geordie,&#8221;
as an air, with other words, might be well worth a place in your
collection of lively songs?</p>

<p>If it were possible to procure songs of merit, it would be proper to
have one set of Scots words to every air, and that the set of words to
which the notes ought to be set. There is a <i>nav&iuml;et&eacute;</i>, a pastoral
simplicity, in a slight intermixture of Scots words and phraseology,
which is more in unison (at least to my taste, and, I will add, to
every genuine Caledonian taste) with the simple pathos, or rustic
sprightliness of our native music, than any English verses whatever.</p>

<p>The very name of Peter Pindar is an acquisition to your work. His
&#8220;Gregory&#8221; is beautiful. I have tried to give you a set of stanzas in
Scots, on the same subject, which are at your service. Not that I
intend to enter the lists with Peter&mdash;that would be presumption
indeed. My song, though much inferior in poetic merit, has, I think,
more of the ballad simplicity in it.</p>

<p>[Here follows &#8220;Lord Gregory.&#8221; Song <a href="#CCXXXVII"><span class="smcap">clxxxvii</span></a>.]</p>

favoured me with a postscript in your last. He shall hear from me and
receive his MSS. soon.</p>

<p>[The seal, with the coat-of-arms which the poet invented, is still in
the family, and regarded as a relique.]</p>

<p class="sig"><i>3d March, 1793.</i></p>

<p>Since I wrote to you the last lugubrious sheet, I have not had time to
write you further. When I say that I had not time, that as usual
means, that the three demons, indolence, business, and ennui, have so
completely shared my hours among them, as not to leave me a five
minutes&#8217; fragment to take up a pen in.</p>

<p>Thank heaven, I feel my spirits buoying upwards with the renovating
year. Now I shall in good earnest take up Thomson&#8217;s songs. I dare say
he thinks I have used him unkindly, and I must own with too much
appearance of truth. Apropos, do you know the much admired old
Highland air called &#8220;The Sutor&#8217;s Dochter?&#8221; It is a first-rate
favourite of mine, and I have written what I reckon one of my best
songs to it. I will send it to you as it was sung with great applause
in some fashionable circles by Major Roberston, of Lude, who was here
with his corps.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>There is one commission that I must trouble you with. I lately lost a
valuable seal, a present from a departed friend which vexes me much.</p>

<p>I have gotten one of your Highland pebbles, which I fancy would make a
very decent one; and I want to cut my armorial bearing on it; will you
be so obliging as inquire what will be the expense of such a business?
I do not know that my name is matriculated, as the heralds call it, at
all; but I have invented arms for myself, so you know I shall be chief
of the name; and, by courtesy of Scotland, will likewise be entitled
to supporters. These, however, I do not intend having on my seal. I am
a bit of a herald, and shall give you, <i>secundum artem</i>, my arms. On a
field, azure, a holly-bush, seeded, proper, in base; a shepherd&#8217;s pipe
and crook, saltier-wise, also proper in chief. On a wreath of the
colours, a wood lark perching on a sprig of bay-tree, proper, for
crest. Two mottos; round the top of the crest, <i>Wood-notes wild</i>: at
the bottom of the shield, in the usual place, <i>Better a wee bush than
nae bield.</i> By the shepherd&#8217;s pipe and crook I do not mean the
nonsense of painters of Arcadia, but a <i>stock and horn</i>, and a <i>club</i>,
such as you see at the head of Allan Ramsay, in Allan&#8217;s quarto edition
of the <i>Gentle Shepherd.</i> By the bye, do you know Allan? He must be a
man of very great genius&mdash;Why is he not more known?&mdash;Has he no
patrons? or do &#8220;Poverty&#8217;s cold wind and crushing rain beat keen and
heavy&#8221; on him! I once, and but once, got a glance of that noble
edition of the noblest pastoral in the world; and dear as it was, I
mean<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[455]</a></span> dear as to my pocket, I would have bought it; but I was told
that it was printed and engraved for subscribers only. He is the
<i>only</i> artist who has hit <i>genuine</i> pastoral <i>costume.</i> What, my dear
Cunningham, is there in riches, that they narrow and harden the heart
so? I think, that were I as rich as the sun, I should be as generous
as the day; but as I have no reason to imagine my soul a nobler one
than any other man&#8217;s, I must conclude that wealth imparts a bird-lime
quality to the possessor, at which the man, in his native poverty,
would have revolted. What has led me to this, is the idea, of such
merit as Mr. Allan possesses, and such riches us a nabob or government
contractor possesses, and why they do not form a mutual league. Let
wealth shelter and cherish unprotected merit, and the gratitude and
celebrity of that merit will richly repay it.</p>

<p>Among many things for which I envy those hale, long-lived old fellows
before the flood, is this in particular, that when they met with
anybody after their own heart, they had a charming long prospect of
many, many happy meetings with them in after-life.</p>

<p>Now in this short, stormy, winter day of our fleeting existence, when
you now and then, in the Chapter of Accidents, meet an individual
whose acquaintance is a real acquisition, there are all the
probabilities against you, that you shall never meet with that valued
character more. On the other hand, brief as this miserable being is,
it is none of the least of the miseries belonging to it, that if there
is any miscreant whom you hate, or creature whom you despise, the
ill-run of the chances shall be so against you, that in the
overtakings, turnings, and jostlings of life, pop, at some unlucky
corner, eternally comes the wretch upon you, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[456]</a></span> will not allow your
indignation or contempt a moment&#8217;s repose. As I am a sturdy believer
in the powers of darkness, I take these to be the doings of that old
author of mischief, the devil. It is well-known that he has some kind
of short-hand way of taking down our thoughts, and I make no doubt he
is perfectly acquainted with my sentiments respecting Miss Benson: how
much I admired her abilities and valued her worth, and how very
fortunate I thought myself in her acquaintance. For this last reason,
my dear Madam, I must entertain no hopes of the very great pleasure of
meeting with you again.</p>

<p>Miss Hamilton tells me that she is sending a packet to you, and I beg
leave to send you the enclosed sonnet, though, to tell you the real
truth, the sonnet is a mere pretence, that I may have the opportunity

<p>[This review of our Scottish lyrics is well worth the attention of all
who write songs, read songs, or sing songs.]</p>

<p class="sig"><i>7th April, 1793.</i></p>

<p>Thank you, my dear Sir, for your packet. You cannot imagine how much
this business of composing for your publication has added to my
enjoyments. What with my early attachment to ballads, your book, &amp;c.,
ballad-making is now as completely my hobby-horse as ever
fortification was Uncle Toby&#8217;s; so I&#8217;ll e&#8217;en canter it away till I
come to the limit of my race&mdash;God grant that I may take the right side
of the winning post!&mdash;and then cheerfully looking back on the honest
folks with whom I have been happy, I shall say or sing, &#8220;Sae merry as
we a&#8217; hae been!&#8221; and, raising my last looks to the whole human race,
the last words of the voice of &#8220;Coila&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a> shall be, &#8220;Good night, and
joy be wi&#8217; you a&#8217;!&#8221; So much for my last words: now for a few present
remarks, as they have occurred at random, on looking over your list.</p>

<p>The first lines of &#8220;The last time I came o&#8217;er the moor,&#8221; and several
other lines in it, are beautiful; but, in my opinion&mdash;pardon me,
revered shade of Ramsay!&mdash;the song is unworthy of the divine air. I
shall try to make or mend.</p>

<p>&#8220;For ever, Fortune, wilt thou prove,&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> is a charming song; but &#8220;Logan
burn and Logan braes&#8221; is sweetly susceptible of rural imagery; I&#8217;ll
try that likewise, and, if I succeed, the other song may class among
the English ones. I remember the two last lines of a verse in some of
the old songs of &#8220;Logan Water&#8221; (for I know a good many different ones)
which I think pretty:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;Now my dear lad maun faces his faes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Far, far frae me and Logan braes.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>&#8220;My Patie is a lover gay,&#8221; is unequal. &#8220;His mind is never muddy,&#8221; is a
muddy expression indeed.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;Then I&#8217;ll resign and marry Pate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And syne my cockernony&mdash;&#8220;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This is surely far unworthy of Ramsay or your book. My song, &#8220;Rigs of
barley,&#8221; to the same tune, does not altogether please me; but if I can
mend it, and thrash a few loose sentiments</p>

<p>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[457]</a></span>
out of it, I will submit it to your consideration. &#8220;The lass o&#8217;
Patie&#8217;s mill&#8221; is one of Ramsay&#8217;s best songs; but there is one loose
sentiment in it, which my much-valued friend Mr. Erskine will take
into his critical consideration. In Sir John Sinclair&#8217;s statistical
volumes, are two claims&mdash;one, I think from Aberdeenshire, and the
other from Ayrshire&mdash;for the honour of this song. The following
anecdote, which I had from the present Sir William Cunningham of
Robertland, who had it of the late John, Earl of Loudon, I can, on
such authorities, believe:</p>

<p>Allan Ramsay was residing at Loudon-castle with the then Earl, father
to Earl John; and one forenoon, riding or walking, out together, his
lordship and Allan passed a sweet romantic spot on Irvine water, still
called &#8220;Patie&#8217;s mill,&#8221; where a bonnie lass was &#8220;tedding hay,
bare-headed on the green.&#8221; My lord observed to Allan, that it would be
a fine theme for a song. Ramsay took the hint, and, lingering behind,
he composed the first sketch of it, which he produced at dinner.</p>

<p>&#8220;One day I heard Mary say,&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> is a fine song; but, for consistency&#8217;s
sake, alter the name &#8220;Adonis.&#8221; Were there ever such banns published,
as a purpose of marriage between Adonis and Mary! I agree with you
that my song, &#8220;There&#8217;s nought but care on every hand,&#8221; is much
superior to &#8220;Poortith cauld.&#8221; The original song, &#8220;The mill, mill,
O!&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> though excellent, is, on account of delicacy, inadmissible;
still I like the title, and think a Scottish song would suit the notes
best; and let your chosen song, which is very pretty, follow as an
English set. &#8220;The Banks of the Dee&#8221; is, you know, literally
&#8220;Langolee,&#8221; to slow time. The song is well enough, but has some false
imagery in it: for instance,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;And sweetly the nightingale sang from the tree.&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In the first place, the nightingale sings in a low bush, but never
from a tree; and in the second place, there never was a nightingale
seen or heard on the banks of the Dee, or on the banks of any other
river in Scotland. Exotic rural imagery is always comparatively
flat.<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> If I could hit on another stanza, equal to &#8220;The small birds
rejoice,&#8221; &amp;c., I do myself honestly avow, that I think it a superior
song.<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a> &#8220;John Anderson, my jo&#8221;&mdash;the song to this tune in Johnson&#8217;s
Museum, is my composition, and I think it not my worst:<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a> if it suit
you, take it, and welcome. Your collection of sentimental and pathetic
songs, is, in my opinion, very complete; but not so your comic ones.
Where are &#8220;Tullochgorum,&#8221; &#8220;Lumps o&#8217; puddin,&#8221; &#8220;Tibbie Fowler,&#8221; and
several others, which, in my humble judgment, are well worthy of
preservation? There is also one sentimental song of mine in the
Museum, which never was known out of the immediate neighbourhood,
until I got it taken down from a country girl&#8217;s singing. It is called
&#8220;Craigieburn wood,&#8221; and, in the opinion of Mr. Clarke, is one of the
sweetest Scottish songs. He is quite an enthusiast about it; and I
would take his taste in Scottish music against the taste of most
connoisseurs.</p>

<p>You are quite right in inserting the last five in your list, though
they are certainly Irish. &#8220;Shepherds, I have lost my love!&#8221; is to me a
heavenly air&mdash;what would you think of a set of Scottish verses to it?
I have made one to it a good while ago, which I think * * *, but in
its original state it is not quite a lady&#8217;s song. I enclose an
altered, not amended copy for you,<a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> if you choose to set the tune to
it, and let the Irish verses follow.</p>

<p>Mr. Erskine&#8217;s songs are all pretty, but his &#8220;Lone-vale&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a> is divine.</p>

<h3>TO MR. THOMSON.</h3>

<p>[The letter to which this is in part an answer, Currie says, contains
many observations on Scottish songs, and on the manner of adapting the
words to the music, which at Mr. Thomson&#8217;s desire are suppressed.]</p>

<p class="sig"><i>April, 1793.</i></p>

<p>I have yours, my dear Sir, this moment. I shall answer it and your
former letter, in my desultory way of saying whatever comes
uppermost.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[458]</a></span></p>

<p>The business of many of our tunes wanting, at the beginning, what
fiddlers call a starting-note, is often a rub to us poor rhymers.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;There&#8217;s braw, braw lads on Yarrow braes,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Ye wander,&#8221; &amp;c.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>My song, &#8220;Here awa, there awa,&#8221; as amended by Mr. Erskine, I entirely
approve of, and return you.</p>

<p>Give me leave to criticise your taste in the only thing in which it
is, in my opinion, reprehensible. You know I ought to know something
of my own trade. Of pathos, sentiment, and point, you are a complete
judge; but there is a quality more necessary than either in a song,
and which is the very essence of a ballad&mdash;I mean simplicity: now, if
I mistake not, this last feature you are a little apt to sacrifice to
the foregoing.</p>

<p>Ramsay, as every other poet, has not been always equally happy in his
pieces; still I cannot approve of taking such liberties with an author
as Mr. Walker proposes doing with &#8220;The last time I came o&#8217;er the
moor.&#8221; Let a poet, if he choose, take up the idea of another, and work
it into a piece of his own; but to mangle the works of the poor bard,
whose tuneful tongue is now mute for ever, in the dark and narrow
house&mdash;by Heaven, &#8217;twould be sacrilege! I grant that Mr. W.&#8217;s version
is an improvement; but I know Mr. W. well, and esteem him much; let
him mend the song, as the Highlander mended his gun&mdash;he gave it a new
stock, a new lock, and a new barrel.</p>

<p>I do not, by this, object to leaving out improper stanzas, where that
can be done without spoiling the whole. One stanza in &#8220;The lass o&#8217;
Patie&#8217;s mill&#8221; must be left out: the song will be nothing worse for it.
I am not sure if we can take the same liberty with &#8220;Corn rigs are
bonnie.&#8221; Perhaps it might want the last stanza, and be the better for
it. &#8220;Cauld kail in Aberdeen,&#8221; you must leave with me yet awhile. I
have vowed to have a song to that air, on the lady whom I attempted to
celebrate in the verses, &#8220;Poortith cauld and restless love.&#8221; At any
rate, my other song, &#8220;Green grow the rashes,&#8221; will never suit. That
song is current in Scotland under the old title, and to the merry old
tune of that name, which, of course, would mar the progress of your
song to celebrity. Your book will be the standard of Scots songs for
the future: let this idea ever keep your judgment on the alarm.</p>

<p>I send a song on a celebrated toast in this country, to suit &#8220;Bonnie
Dundee.&#8221; I send you also a ballad to the &#8220;Mill, mill, O!&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a></p>

<p>&#8220;The last time I came o&#8217;er the moor,&#8221; I would fain attempt to make a
Scots song for, and let Ramsay&#8217;s be the English set. You shall hear
from me soon. When you go to London on this business, can you come by
Dumfries? I have still several MS. Scots airs by me, which I have
picked up, mostly from the singing of country lasses. They please me
vastly; but your learned <i>lugs</i> would perhaps be displeased with the
very feature for which I like them. I call them simple; you would
pronounce them silly. Do you know a fine air called &#8220;Jackie Hume&#8217;s
Lament?&#8221; I have a song of considerable merit to that air. I&#8217;ll enclose
you both the song and tune, as I had them ready to send to Johnson&#8217;s
Museum.<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> I send you likewise, to me, a beautiful little air, which I

<p>[Thomson, it would appear by his answer to this letter, was at issue

leave on this, as on every other occasion, to you to decide. I own my
vanity is flattered, when you give my songs a place in your elegant
and superb work; but to be of service to the work is my first wish. As
I have <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[459]</a></span>
often told you, I do not in a single instance wish you, out of
compliment to me, to insert anything of mine. One hint let me give
you&mdash;whatever Mr. Pleyel does, let him not alter one iota of the
original Scottish airs, I mean in the song department, but let our
national music preserve its native features. They are, I own,
frequently wild and irreducible to the more modern rules; but on that
very eccentricity, perhaps, depends a great part of their effect.</p>

<h3>TO JOHN FRANCIS ERSKINE, ESQ.,</h3>

<h4>OF M A R.</h4>

<p>[This remarkable letter has been of late the subject of some
controversy: Mr. Findlater, who happened then to be in the Excise, is
vehement in defence of the &#8220;honourable board,&#8221; and is certain that
Burns has misrepresented the conduct of his very generous masters. In
answer to this it has been urged that the word of the poet has in no
other thing been questioned: that in the last moments of his life, he
solemnly wrote this letter into his memorandum-book, and that the
reproof of Mr. Corbet, is given by him either as a quotation from a
paper or an exact recollection of the words used: the expressions,
&#8220;<i>not to think</i>&#8221; and be &#8220;<i>silent</i> and <i>obedient</i>&#8221; are underlined.]</p>

<p class="sig"><i>Dumfries, 13th April, 1793.</i></p>

<p class="sig7"><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>

<p>Degenerate as human nature is said to be, and in many instances,
worthless and unprincipled it is, still there are bright examples to
the contrary; examples that even in the eyes of superior beings, must
shed a lustre on the name of man.</p>

<p>Such an example have I now before me, when you, Sir, came forward to
patronize and befriend a distant, obscure stranger, merely because
poverty had made him helpless, and his British hardihood of mind had
provoked the arbitrary wantonness of power. My much esteemed friend,
Mr. Riddel of Glenriddel, has just read me a paragraph of a letter he
had from you. Accept, Sir, of the silent throb of gratitude; for words
would but mock the emotions of my soul.</p>

<p>You have been misinformed as to my final dismission from the Excise; I
am still in the service.&mdash;Indeed, but for the exertions of a gentleman
who must be known to you, Mr. Graham of Fintray, a gentleman who has
ever been my warm and generous friend, I had, without so much us a
hearing, or the slightest previous intimation, been turned adrift,
with my helpless family, to all the horrors of want. Had I had any
other resource, probably I might have saved them the trouble of a
dismission; but the little money I gained by my publication, is almost
every guinea embarked, to save from ruin an only brother, who, though
one of the worthiest, is by no means one of the most fortunate of men.</p>

<p>In my defence to their accusations, I said, that whatever might be my
sentiments of republics, ancient or modern, as to Britain, I abjured
the idea!&mdash;That a <span class="smcap">constitution</span>, which, in its original
principles, experience had proved to be every way fitted for our
happiness in society, it would be insanity to sacrifice to an untried
visionary theory:&mdash;that, in consideration of my being situated in a
department, however humble, immediately in the hands of people in
power, I had forborne taking any active part, either personally, or as
an author, in the present business of Reform. But, that, where I must
declare my sentiments, I would say there existed a system of
corruption between the executive power and the representative part of
the legislature, which boded no good to our glorious
<span class="smcap">constitution</span>; and which every patriotic Briton must wish to
see amended.&mdash;Some such sentiments as these, I stated in a letter to
my generous patron, Mr. Graham, which he laid before the Board at
large; where, it seems, my last remark gave great offence; and one of
our supervisors-general, a Mr. Corbet, was instructed to inquire on
the spot, and to document me&mdash;&#8220;that my business was to act, <i>not to
think;</i> and that whatever might be men or measures, it was for me to
be <i>silent</i> and <i>obedient.</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Corbet was likewise my steady friend; so between Mr. Graham and
him, I have been partly forgiven; only I understand that all hopes of
my getting officially forward, are blasted.</p>

<p>Now, Sir, to the business in which I would more immediately interest
you. The partiality of my <span class="smcap">countrymen</span> has brought me forward
as a man of genius, and has given me a character to support. In the
Poet I have avowed manly and independent sentiments, which I trust
will be found in the man. Reasons of no less weight than the support
of a wife and family, have pointed out as the eligible, and, situated
as I was, the only eligible line of life for me, my present
occupation. Still my honest fame is my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[460]</a></span> dearest concern; and a
thousand times have I trembled at the idea of those <i>degrading</i>
epithets that malice or misrepresentation may affix to my name. I have
often, in blasting anticipation, listened to some future hackney
scribbler, with the heavy malice of savage stupidity, exulting in his
hireling paragraphs&mdash;&#8220;Burns, notwithstanding the <i>fanfaronade</i> of
independence to be found in his works, and after having been held
forth to public view and to public estimation as a man of some genius,
yet quite destitute of resources within himself to support his
borrowed dignity, he dwindled into a paltry exciseman, and slunk out
the rest of his insignificant existence in the meanest of pursuits,
and among the vilest of mankind.&#8221;</p>

<p>In your illustrious hands, Sir, permit me to lodge my disavowal and
defiance of these slanderous falsehoods. <span class="smcap">Burns</span> was a poor man
from birth, and an exciseman by necessity: but I <i>will</i> say it! the
sterling of his honest worth, no poverty could debase, and his
independent British mind, oppression might bend, but could not subdue.
Have not I, to me, a more precious stake in my country&#8217;s welfare than
the richest dukedom in it?&mdash;I have a large family of children, and the
prospect of many more. I have three sons, who, I see already, have
brought into the world souls ill qualified to inhabit the bodies of
<span class="smcap">slaves</span>.&mdash;Can I look tamely on, and see any machination to
wrest from them the birthright of my boys,&mdash;the little independent
<span class="smcap">Britons</span>, in whose veins runs my own blood?&mdash;No! I will not!
should my heart&#8217;s blood stream around my attempt to defend it!</p>

<p>Does any man tell me, that my full efforts can be of no service; and
that it does not belong to my humble station to meddle with the
concern of a nation?</p>

<p>I can tell him, that it is on such individuals as I, that a nation has
to rest, both for the hand of support, and the eye of intelligence.
The uninformed mob may swell a nation&#8217;s bulk; and the titled, tinsel,
courtly throng, may be its feathered ornament; but the number of those
who are elevated enough in life to reason and to reflect; yet low
enough to keep clear of the venal contagion of a court!&mdash;these are a
nation&#8217;s strength.</p>

<p>I know not how to apologize for the impertinent length of this
epistle; but one small request I must ask of you further&mdash;when you
have honoured this letter with a perusal, please to commit it to the
flames. <span class="smcap">Burns</span>, in whose behalf you have so generously
interested yourself, I have here in his native colours drawn <i>as he
is</i>, but should any of the people in whose hands is the very bread he
eats, get the least knowledge of the picture, <i>it would ruin the poor</i>
<span class="smcap">bard</span> <i>for ever</i>!</p>

<p>My poems having just come out in another edition, I beg leave to
present you with a copy, as a small mark of that high esteem and
ardent gratitude, with which I have the honour to be,</p>

<p class="sig10">Sir,</p>

<p>[&#8220;Up tails a&#8217;, by the light o&#8217; the moon,&#8221; was the name of a Scottish

<p>I am d&mdash;mnably out of humour, my dear Ainslie, and that is the reason,
why I take up the pen to <i>you</i>: &#8217;tis the nearest way (<i>probatum est</i>)
to recover my spirits again.</p>

<p>I received your last, and was much entertained with it; but I will not
at this time, nor at any other time, answer it.&mdash;Answer a letter? I
never could answer a letter in my life!&mdash;I have written many a letter
in return for letters I have received; but then&mdash;they were original
matter&mdash;spurt-away! zig here, zag there; as if the devil that, my
Grannie (an old woman indeed) often told me, rode on will-o&#8217;-wisp, or,
in her more classic phrase, <span class="smcap">Spunkie</span>, were looking over my
elbow.&mdash;Happy thought that idea has engendered in my head!
<span class="smcap">Spunkie</span>&mdash;thou shalt henceforth be my symbol signature, and
tutelary genius! Like thee, hap-step-and-lowp, here-awa-there-awa,
higglety-pigglety, pell-mell, hither-and-yon, ram-stam,
happy-go-lucky, up-tails-a&#8217;-by-the-light-o&#8217;-the-moon,&mdash;has been, is,
and shall be, my progress through the mosses and moors of this vile,
bleak, barren wilderness of a life of ours.</p>

<p>Come then, my guardian spirit, like thee may I skip away, amusing
myself by and at my own light: and if any opaque-souled lubber of
mankind complain that my elfine, lambent, glim<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[461]</a></span> merous wanderings have
misled his stupid steps over precipices, or into bogs, let the

<p>I have no doubt but scholar-craft may be caught, as a Scotchman catches
the itch,&mdash;by friction. How else can you account for it, that born
blockheads, by mere dint of <i>handling</i> books, grow so wise that even
they themselves are equally convinced of and surprised at their own
parts? I once carried this philosophy to that degree that in a knot of
country folks who had a library amongst them, and who, to the honour
of their good sense, made me factotum in the business; one of our
members, a little, wise-looking, squat, upright, jabbering body of a
tailor, I advised him, instead of turning over the leaves, <i>to bind
the book on his back.</i>&mdash;Johnnie took the hint; and as our meetings
were every fourth Saturday, and Pricklouse having a good Scots mile to
walk in coming, and, of course, another in returning, Bodkin was sure
to lay his hand on some heavy quarto, or ponderous folio, with, and
under which, wrapt up in his gray plaid, he grew wise, as he grew
weary, all the way home. He carried this so far, that an old musty
Hebrew concordance, which we had in a present from a neighbouring
priest, by mere dint of applying it, as doctors do a blistering
plaster, between his shoulders, Stitch, in a dozen pilgrimages,
acquired as much rational theology as the said priest had done by
forty years perusal of the pages.</p>

<p>Permit me to present you with the enclosed song as a small though
grateful tribute for the honour of your acquaintance. I have, in these
verses, attempted some faint sketches of your portrait in the
unembellished simple manner of descriptive <span class="smcap">truth</span>.&mdash;Flattery,
I leave to your <span class="smcap">lovers</span>, whose exaggerating fancies may make
them imagine you still nearer perfection than you really are.</p>

<p>Poets, Madam, of all mankind, feel most forcibly the powers of
<span class="smcap">beauty</span>; as, if they are really poets of nature&#8217;s making,
their feelings must be finer, and their taste more delicate than most
of the world. In the cheerful bloom of <span class="smcap">spring</span>, or the pensive
mildness of <span class="smcap">autumn</span>; the grandeur of <span class="smcap">summer</span>, or the
hoary majesty of <span class="smcap">winter</span>, the poet feels a charm unknown to
the rest of his species. Even the sight of a fine flower, or the
company of a fine woman (by far the finest part of God&#8217;s works below),
have sensations for the poetic heart that the <span class="smcap">herd</span> of man are
strangers to.&mdash;On this last account, Madam, I am, as in many other
things, indebted to Mr. Hamilton&#8217;s kindness in introducing me to you.
Your lovers may view you with a wish, I look on you with pleasure;
their hearts, in your presence, may glow with desire, mine rises with
admiration.</p>

<p>That the arrows of misfortune, however they should, as incident to
humanity, glance a slight wound, may never reach your <i>heart</i>&mdash;that
the snares of villany may never beset you in the road of life&mdash;that
<span class="smcap">innocence</span> may hand you by the path of honour to the dwelling
of <span class="smcap">peace</span>, is the sincere wish of him who has the honour to
be, &amp;c.</p>

<p>When I tell you, my dear Sir, that a friend of mine in whom I am much
interested, has fallen a sacrifice to these accursed times, you will
easily allow that it might unhinge me for doing any good among
ballads. My own loss as to pecuniary matters is trifling; but the
total ruin of a much-loved friend is a loss indeed. Pardon my seeming
inattention to your last commands.</p>

<p>I cannot alter the disputed lines in the &#8220;Mill<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[462]</a></span> Mill, O!&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_222_222" id="FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a> What you

<p>You know Frazer, the hautboy-player in Edinburgh&mdash;he is here,
instructing a band of music for a fencible corps quartered in this
county. Among many of his airs that please me, there is one, well
known as a reel, by the name of &#8220;The Quaker&#8217;s Wife;&#8221; and which, I
remember, a grand-aunt of mine used to sing, by the name of &#8220;Liggeram
Cosh, my bonnie wee lass.&#8221; Mr. Frazer plays it slow, and with an
expression that quite charms me. I became such an enthusiast about it,
that I made a song for it, which I here subjoin, and enclose Frazer&#8217;s
set of the tune. If they hit your fancy, they are at your service; if
not, return me the tune, and I will put it in Johnson&#8217;s Museum. I

<p>Have you ever, my dear Sir, felt your bosom ready to burst with
indignation, on reading of those mighty villains who divide kingdoms,
desolate provinces, and lay nations waste, out of the wantonness of
ambition, or often from still more ignoble passions? In a mood of this
kind to-day I recollected the air of &#8220;Logan Water,&#8221; and it occurred to
me that its querulous melody probably had its origin from the
plaintive indignation of some swelling, suffering heart, fired at the
tyrannic strides of some public destroyer, and overwhelmed with
private distress, the consequence of a country&#8217;s ruin. If I have done
anything at all like justice to my feelings, the following song,
composed in three-quarters of an hour&#8217;s meditation in my elbow-chair,
ought to have some merit:&mdash;</p>

<p>I have just finished the following ballad, and, as I do think it in my
best style, I send it you. Mr. Clarke, who wrote down the air from
Mrs. Burns&#8217;s wood-note wild, is very fond of it, and has given it a
celebrity by teaching it to some young ladies of the first fashion
here. If you do not like the air enough to give it a place in your

<p>[Burns in this letter speaks of the pecuniary present which Thomson
sent him, in a lofty and angry mood: he who published poems by
subscription might surely have accepted, without any impropriety,
payment for his songs.]</p>

<p class="sig"><i>July, 1793.</i></p>

<p>I assure you, my dear Sir, that you truly hurt me with your pecuniary
parcel. It degrades me in my own eyes. However, to return it would
savour of affectation; but, as to any more traffic of that debtor and
creditor kind, I swear by that <span class="smcap">honour</span> which crowns the
upright statue of <span class="smcap">Robert Burns&#8217;s Integrity</span>&mdash;on the least
motion of it, I will indignantly spurn the by-past transaction, and
from that moment commence entire stranger to you! <span class="smcap">Burns&#8217;s</span>
character for generosity of sentiment and independence of mind, will,
I trust, long outlive any of his wants which the cold unfeeling ore
can supply; at least, I will take care that such a character he shall
deserve.</p>

<p>Thank you for my copy of your publication. Never did my eyes behold in
any musical work such elegance and correctness. Your preface, too, is
admirably written, only your partiality to me has made you say too
much: however, it will bind me down to double every effort in the
future progress of the work. The following are a few remarks on the
songs in the list you sent me. I never copy what I write to you, so I
may be often tautological, or perhaps contradictory.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Flowers o&#8217; the Forest,&#8221; is charming as a poem, and should be, and
must be, set to the notes; but, though out of your rule, the three
stanzas beginning,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;I&#8217;ve seen the smiling of fortune beguiling,&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>are worthy of a place, were it but to immortalize the author of them,
who is an old lady of my acquaintance, and at this moment living in
Edinburgh. She is a Mrs. Cockburn, I forget of what place, but from
Roxburghshire.<a name="FNanchor_228_228" id="FNanchor_228_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a> What a charming apostrophe is</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;O fickle fortune, why this cruel sporting,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why thus perplex us, poor sons of a day?&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The old ballad, &#8220;I wish I were where Helen lies,&#8221; is silly to
contemptibility. My alteration of it, in Johnson&#8217;s, is not much
better. Mr. Pinkerton, in his, what he calls, ancient ballads (many of
them notorious, though beautiful enough, forgeries), has the best set.
It is full of his own interpolations&mdash;but no matter.</p>

<p>In my next I will suggest to your consideration a few songs which may
have escaped your hurried notice. In the meantime allow me to
congratulate you now, as a brother of the quill. You have committed
your character and fame, which will now be tried, for ages to come, by
the illustrious jury of the <span class="smcap">Sons and Daughters of Taste</span>&mdash;all
whom poesy can please or music charm.</p>

<p>Being a bard of nature, I have some pretensions to second sight; and I
am warranted by the spirit to foretell and affirm, that your
great-grand-child will hold up your volumes, and say, with honest
pride, &#8220;This so much admired selection was the work of my ancestor!&#8221;</p>

<p>[The infusion of Highland airs and north country subjects into the
music and songs of Scotland, has invigorated both: Burns, who had a
fine ear as well as a fine taste, was familiar with all, either
Highland or Lowland.]</p>

<p class="sig"><i>August</i>, 1793.</p>

<p>That crinkum-crankum tune, &#8220;Robin Adair,&#8221; has run so in my head, and I
succeeded so ill in my last attempt, that I have ventured, in this
morning&#8217;s walk, one essay more. You, my dear Sir, will remember an
unfortunate part of our worthy friend Cunningham&#8217;s story, which
happened about three years ago. That struck my fancy, and I
endeavoured to do the idea justice as follows:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Had I a cave on some wild distant shore.<a name="FNanchor_230_230" id="FNanchor_230_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>By the way, I have met with a musical Highlander in Breadalbane&#8217;s
Fencibles, which are quartered here, who assures me that he well
remembers his mother singing Gaelic songs to both &#8220;Robin Adair,&#8221; and
&#8220;Grammachree.&#8221; They certainly have more of the Scotch than Irish taste
in them.</p>

<p>This man comes from the vicinity of Inverness: so it could not be any
intercourse with Ireland that could bring them; except, what I
shrewdly suspect to be the case, the wandering minstrels, harpers, and
pipers, used to go frequently errant through the wilds both of
Scotland and Ireland, and so some favourite airs might be common to
both. A case in point&mdash;they have lately, in Ireland, published an
Irish air, as they say, called &#8220;Caun du delish.&#8221; The fact is, in a
publication of Corri&#8217;s, a great while ago, you will find the same air,
called a Highland one, with a Gaelic song set to it. Its name there, I
think, is &#8220;Oran Gaoil,&#8221; and a fine air it is. Do ask honest Allan or
the Rev. Gaelic parson, about these matters.</p>

<p>[While Burns composed songs, Thomson got some of the happiest embodied
by David Allan, the painter, whose illustrations of the Gentle
Shepherd had been favourably received. But save when an old man was
admitted to the scene, his designs may be regarded as failures: his
maidens were coarse and his old wives rigwiddie carlins.]</p>

<p class="sig7"><span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me in this ae night&#8221; I will reconsider. I am glad that you are
pleased with my song, &#8220;Had I a cave,&#8221; &amp;c., as I liked it myself.</p>

<p>I walked out yesterday evening with a volume of the Museum in my hand,
when turning up &#8220;Allan Water,&#8221; &#8220;What numbers shall the muse repeat,&#8221;
&amp;c., as the words appeared to me rather unworthy of so fine an air,
and recollecting that it is on your list, I sat and raved under the
shade of an old thorn, till I wrote one to suit the measure. I may be
wrong; but I think it not in my worst style. You must know, that in
Ramsay&#8217;s Tea-table, where the modern song first appeared, the ancient
name of the tune, Allan says, is &#8220;Allan Water,&#8221; or &#8220;My love Annie&#8217;s
very bonnie.&#8221; This last has certainly been a line of the original
song; so I took up the idea, and, as you will see, have introduced the
line in its place, which I presume it formerly occupied; though I
likewise give you a choosing line, if it should not hit the cut of
your fancy:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">By Allan stream I chanced to rove.<a name="FNanchor_231_231" id="FNanchor_231_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a><br /></span>

<p>Bravo! say I; it is a good song. Should you think so too (not else)
you can set the music to it, and let the other follow as English
verses.</p>

<p>Autumn is my propitious season. I make more verses in it than all the
year else. God bless you!</p>

<p>Is &#8220;Whistle, and I&#8217;ll come to you, my lad,&#8221; one of your airs? I admire
it much; and yesterday I set the following verses to it. Urbani, whom
I have met with here, begged them of me, as he admires the air much;
but as I understand that he looks with rather an evil eye on your
work, I did not choose to comply. However, if the song does not suit
your taste I may possibly send it him. The set of the air which I had
in my eye, is in Johnson&#8217;s Museum.</p>

<p>Mr. Clarke begs you to give Miss Phillis a corner in your book, as she
is a particular flame of his, and out of compliment to him I have made
the song. She is a Miss Phillis M&#8217;Murdo, sister to &#8220;Bonnie Jean.&#8221; They

<h3>TO MR. THOMSON.</h3>

<p>[Burns was fond of expressive words: &#8220;Gloaming, the twilight,&#8221; says
Currie, &#8220;is a beautiful poetic word, which ought to be adopted in
England.&#8221; Burns and Scott have made the Scottish language popular over
the world.]</p>

<p class="sig"><i>August</i>, 1793.</p>

<p>That tune, &#8220;Cauld kail,&#8221; is such a favourite of yours, that I once
more roved out yesterday for a gloamin-shot at the muses; when the
muse that presides o&#8217;er the shores of Nith, or rather my old inspiring
dearest nymph, Coila, whispered me the following. I have two reasons
for thinking that it was my early, sweet simple inspirer that was by
my elbow, &#8220;smooth gliding without step,&#8221; and pouring the song on my
glowing fancy. In the first place, since I left Coila&#8217;s native haunts,
not a fragment of a poet has arisen to cheer her solitary musings, by
catching inspiration from her, so I more than suspect that she has
followed me hither, or, at least, makes me occasional visits;
secondly, the last stanza of this song I send you, is the very words
that Coila taught me many years ago, and which I set to an old Scots
reel in Johnson&#8217;s Museum.</p>

<p>If you think the above will suit your idea of <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[466]</a></span>your favourite air, I shall be highly pleased. &#8220;The last time I came
o&#8217;er the moor&#8221; I cannot meddle with, as to mending it; and the musical
world have been so long accustomed to Ramsay&#8217;s words, that a different
song, though positively superior, would not be so well received. I am
not fond of choruses to songs, so I have not made one for the
foregoing.</p>

<h3>TO MISS CRAIK.</h3>

<p>[Miss Helen Craik of Arbigland, had merit both as a poetess and
novelist: her ballads may be compared with those of Hector M&#8217;Neil: her
novels had a seasoning of satire in them.]</p>

<p class="sig"><i>Dumfries, August</i>, 1793.</p>

<p class="sig7"><span class="smcap">Madam</span>,</p>

<p>Some rather unlooked-for accidents have prevented my doing myself the
honour of a second visit to Arbigland, as I was so hospitably invited,
and so positively meant to have done.&mdash;However, I still hope to have
that pleasure before the busy months of harvest begin.</p>

<p>I enclose you two of my late pieces, as some kind of return for the
pleasure I have received in perusing a certain MS. volume of poems in
the possession of Captain Riddel. To repay one with an <i>old song</i>, is
a proverb, whose force, you, Madam, I know, will not allow. What is
said of illustrious descent is, I believe, equally true of a talent
for poetry, none ever despised it who had pretensions to it. The fates
and characters of the rhyming tribe often employ my thoughts when I am
disposed to be melancholy. There is not, among all the martyrologies
that ever were penned, so rueful a narrative as the lives of the
poets.&mdash;In the comparative view of wretches, the criterion is not what
they are doomed to suffer, but how they are formed to bear. Take a
being of our kind, give him a stronger imagination and a more delicate
sensibility, which between them will ever engender a more ungovernable
set of passions than are the usual lot of man; implant in him an
irresistible impulse to some idle vagary, such as arranging wild
flowers in fantastical nosegays, tracing the grasshopper to his haunt
by his chirping song, watching the frisks of the little minnows in the
sunny pool, or hunting after the intrigues of butterflies&mdash;in short,
send him adrift after some pursuit which shall eternally mislead him
from the paths of lucre, and yet curse him with a keener relish than
any man living for the pleasures that lucre can purchase; lastly, fill
up the measure of his woes by bestowing on him a spurning sense of his
own dignity, and you have created a wight nearly as miserable as a
poet. To you, Madam, I need not recount the fairy pleasures the muse
bestows to counterbalance this catalogue of evils. Bewitching poetry
is like bewitching woman; she has in all ages been accused of
misleading mankind from the councils of wisdom and the paths of
prudence, involving them in difficulties, baiting them with poverty,
branding them with infamy, and plunging them in the whirling vortex of
ruin; yet, where is the man but must own that all our happiness on
earth is not worthy the name&mdash;that even the holy hermit&#8217;s solitary
prospect of paradisiacal bliss is but the glitter of a northern sun
rising over a frozen region, compared with the many pleasures, the
nameless raptures that we owe to the lovely queen of the heart of man!</p>

<h3>TO LADY GLENCAIRN.</h3>

<p>[Burns, as the concluding paragraph of this letter proves, continued
to the last years of his life to think of the composition of a
Scottish drama, which Sir Walter<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[467]</a></span> Scott laments he did not write,
instead of pouring out multitudes of lyrics for Johnson and Thomson.]</p>

<p class="sig7"><span class="smcap">My Lady</span>,</p>

<p>The honour you have done your poor poet, in writing him so very
obliging a letter, and the pleasure the enclosed beautiful verses have
given him, came very seasonably to his aid, amid the cheerless gloom
and sinking despondency of diseased nerves and December weather. As to
forgetting the family of Glencairn, Heaven is my witness with what
sincerity I could use those old verses which please me more in their
rude simplicity than the most elegant lines I ever saw.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;If thee, Jerusalem, I forget,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Skill part from my right hand.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">My tongue to my mouth&#8217;s roof let cleave,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">If I do thee forget,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Jerusalem, and thee above<br /></span>
<span class="i2">My chief joy do not set.&#8221;&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>When I am tempted to do anything improper, I dare not, because I look
on myself as accountable to your ladyship and family. Now and then,
when I have the honour to be called to the tables of the great, if I
happen to meet with any mortification from the stately stupidity of
self-sufficient squires, or the luxurious insolence of upstart nabobs,
I get above the creatures by calling to remembrance that I am
patronized by the noble house of Glencairn; and at gala-times, such as
new-year&#8217;s day, a christening, or the kirn-night, when my punch-bowl
is brought from its dusty corner and filled up in honour of the
occasion, I begin with,&mdash;<i>The Countess of Glencairn!</i> My good woman
with the enthusiasm of a grateful heart, next cries, <i>My Lord!</i> and so
the toast goes on until I end with <i>Lady Harriet&#8217;s little angel!</i>
whose epithalamium I have pledged myself to write.</p>

<p>When I received your ladyship&#8217;s letter, I was just in the act of
transcribing for you some verses I have lately composed; and meant to
have sent them my first leisure hour, and acquainted you with my late
change of life. I mentioned to my lord my fears concerning my farm.
Those fears were indeed too true; it is a bargain would have ruined
me, but for the lucky circumstance of my having an excise commission.</p>

<p>People may talk as they please, of the ignominy of the excise; 50<i>l.</i>
a year will support my wife and children, and keep me independent of
the world; and I would much rather have it said that my profession
borrowed credit from me, than that I borrowed credit from my
profession. Another advantage I have in this business, is the
knowledge it gives me of the various shades of human character,
consequently assisting me vastly in my poetic pursuits. I had the most
ardent enthusiasm for the muses when nobody knew me, but myself, and
that ardour is by no means cooled now that my lord Glencairn&#8217;s
goodness has introduced me to all the world. Not that I am in haste
for the press. I have no idea of publishing, else I certainly had
consulted my noble generous patron; but after acting the part of an
honest man, and supporting my family, my whole wishes and views are
directed to poetic pursuits. I am aware that though I were to give
performances to the world superior to my former works, still if they
were of the same kind with those, the comparative reception they would
meet with would mortify me. I have turned my thoughts on the drama. I
do not mean the stately buskin of the tragic muse.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Does not your ladyship think that an Edinburgh theatre would be more
amused with affectation, folly, and whim of true Scottish growth, than
manners which by far the greatest part of the audience can only know
at second hand?</p>

<p class="sig2">I have the honour to be,</p>

<p class="sig3">Your ladyship&#8217;s ever devoted</p>

<p class="sig4">And grateful humble servant,</p>

<h3>TO MR. THOMSON.</h3>

<p>[Peter Pindar, the name under which it was the pleasure of that bitter
but vulgar satirist, Dr. Wolcot, to write, was a man of little lyrical
talent. He purchased a good annuity for the remainder of his life, by
the copyright of his works, and survived his popularity many year.]</p>

<p class="sig"><i>Sept.</i> 1793.</p>

<p>You may readily trust, my dear Sir, that any exertion in my power is
heartily at your service. But one thing I must hint to you; the very
name of Peter Pindar is of great service to your publication, so get a
verse from him now and then; though I have no objection, as well as I
can, to bear the burden of the business.</p>

<p>You know that my pretensions to musical taste are merely a few of
nature&#8217;s instincts, untaught and untutored by art. For this reason,
many musical compositions, particularly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[468]</a></span> where much of the merit lies
in counterpoint, however they may transport and ravish the ears of
your connoisseurs, affect my simple lug no otherwise than merely as
melodious din. On the other hand, by way of amends, I am delighted
with many little melodies, which the learned musician despises as
silly and insipid. I do not know whether the old air &#8220;Hey tuttie
taitie,&#8221; may rank among this number; but well I know that, with
Frazer&#8217;s haut-boy, it has often filled my eyes with tears. There is a
tradition, which I have met with in many places in Scotland, that it
was Robert Bruce&#8217;s march at the battle of Bannockburn. This thought,
in yesternight&#8217;s evening walk, warmed me to a pitch of enthusiasm on
the theme of liberty and independence, which I threw into a kind of
Scottish ode, fitted to the air, that one might suppose to be the
gallant Royal Scot&#8217;s address to his heroic followers on the eventful
morning.</p>

</div></div>

<p>So may God ever defend the cause of truth and liberty, as he did that
day! Amen.</p>

<p>P.S. I showed the air to Urbani, who was highly pleased with it, and
begged me to make soft verses for it; but I had no idea of giving
myself any trouble on the subject, till the accidental recollection of
that glorious struggle for freedom, associated with the glowing ideas
of some other struggles of the same nature, not quite so ancient,
roused my rhyming mania. Clarke&#8217;s set of the tune, with his bass, you
will find in the Museum, though I am afraid that the air is not what
will entitle it to a place in your elegant selection.<a name="FNanchor_238_238" id="FNanchor_238_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a></p>

<p class="sig"><i>Sept.</i> 1793.</p>

<p>I dare say, my dear Sir, that you will begin to think my
correspondence is persecution. No matter, I can&#8217;t help it; a ballad is
my hobby-horse, which, though otherwise a simple sort of harmless
idiotical beast enough, has yet this blessed headstrong property, that
when once it has fairly made off with a hapless wight, it gets so
enamoured with the tinkle-gingle, tinkle-gingle of its own bells, that
it is sure to run poor pilgarlick, the bedlam jockey, quite beyond any
useful point or post in the common race of men.</p>

<p>The following song I have composed for &#8220;Oran-gaoil,&#8221; the Highland air
that, you tell me in your last, you have resolved to give a place to

<p>&#8220;Down the burn, Davie.&#8221; I have this moment tried an alteration,
leaving out the last half of the third stanza, and the first half of
the last stanza, thus:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">As down the burn they took their way,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And thro&#8217; the flowery dale;<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>&#8220;Thro&#8217; the wood, laddie&#8221;&mdash;I am decidedly of opinion that both in this,
and &#8220;There&#8217;ll never be peace till Jamie comes hame,&#8221; the second or
high part of the tune being a repetition of the first part an octave
higher, is only for instrumental music, and would be much better
omitted in singing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cowden-knowes.&#8221; Remember in your index that the song in pure English
to this tune, beginning,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;When summer comes, the swains on Tweed,&#8221;<br /></span>

<p>&#8220;Laddie, lie near me,&#8221; must lie by me for some time. I do not know the
air; and until I am complete master of a tune, in my own singing (such
as it is), I can never compose for it. My way is: I consider the
poetic sentiment correspondent to my idea of the musical expression;
then choose my theme; begin one stanza: when that is composed, which
is generally the most difficult part of the business, I walk out, sit
down now and then, look out for objects of nature around me that are
in unison and harmony with the cogitations of my fancy, and workings
of my bosom; humming every now and then the air with the verses I have
framed. When I feel my muse beginning to jade, I retire to the
solitary fire-side of my study, and there commit my effusions to
paper; swinging at intervals on the hind-legs of my elbow-chair, by
way of calling forth my own critical strictures as my pen goes on.
Seriously, this, at home, is almost invariably my way.</p>

<p>What cursed egotism!</p>

<p>&#8220;Gil Morice&#8221; I am for leaving out. It is a plaguy length; the air
itself is never sung; and its place can well be supplied by one or two
songs for fine airs that are not in your list&mdash;for instance
&#8220;Craigieburn-wood&#8221; and &#8220;Roy&#8217;s wife.&#8221; The first, beside its intrinsic
merit, has novelty, and the last has high merit as well as great
celebrity. I have the original words of a song for the last air, in
the handwriting of the lady who composed it; and they are superior to
any edition of the song which the public has yet seen.</p>

<p>&#8220;Highland laddie.&#8221; The old set will please a mere Scotch ear best; and
the new an Italianised one. There is a third, and what Oswald calls
the old &#8220;Highland laddie,&#8221; which pleases me more than either of them.
It is sometimes called &#8220;Ginglin Johnnie;&#8221; it being the air of an old
humorous tawdry song of that name. You will find it in the Museum, &#8220;I
hae been at Crookieden,&#8221; &amp;c. I would advise you, in the musical
quandary, to offer up your prayers to the muses for inspiring
direction; and in the meantime, waiting for this direction, bestow a
libation to Bacchus; and there is not a doubt but you will hit on a
judicious choice. <i>Probatum est.</i></p>

the most beautiful, lovely woman in the world. As I purpose giving you

future edition of your work, perhaps half a century hence, you must
certainly include &#8220;The bonniest lass in a&#8217; the warld,&#8221; in your
collection.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dainty Davie&#8221; I have heard sung nineteen thousand nine hundred and
ninety-nine times, and always with the chorus to the low part of the
tune; and nothing has surprised me so much as your opinion on this
subject. If it will not suit as I proposed, we will lay two of the
stanzas together, and then make the chorus follow, exactly as Lucky
Nancy in the Museum.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fee him, father:&#8221; I enclose you Frazer&#8217;s set of this tune when he
plays it slow: in fact he makes it the language of despair. I shall
here give you two stanzas, in that style, merely to try if it will be
any improvement. Were it possible, in singing, to give it half the
pathos which Frazer gives it in playing, it would make an admirably
pathetic song. I do not give these verses for any merit they have. I
composed them at the time in which &#8220;Patie Allan&#8217;s mither died&mdash;that
was about the back o&#8217; midnight;&#8221; and by the lee-side of a bowl of
punch, which had overset every mortal in company except the hautbois
and the muse.</p>

<p>Thou hast left me ever, Jamie.<a name="FNanchor_243_243" id="FNanchor_243_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a></p>

<p>&#8220;Jockie and Jenny&#8221; I would discard, and in its place would put
&#8220;There&#8217;s nae luck about the house,&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_244_244" id="FNanchor_244_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a> which has a very pleasant air,
and which is positively the finest love-ballad in that style in the
Scottish, or perhaps in any other language. &#8220;When she came ben she
bobbit,&#8221; as an air is more beautiful than either, and in the <i>andante</i>
way would unite with a charming sentimental ballad.</p>

<p>&#8220;Saw ye my father?&#8221; is one of my greatest favourites. The evening
before last, I wandered out, and began a tender song, in what I think
is its native style. I must premise that the old way, and the way to
give most effect, is to have no starting note, as the fiddlers call
it, but to <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[470]</a></span>
burst at once into the pathos. Every country girl sings &#8220;Saw ye my
father?&#8221; &amp;c.</p>

<p>My song is but just begun; and I should like, before I proceed, to
know your opinion of it. I have sprinkled it with the Scottish
dialect, but it may be easily turned into correct English.<a name="FNanchor_245_245" id="FNanchor_245_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a></p>

<p>&#8220;Todlin hame.&#8221; Urbani mentioned an idea of his, which has long been
mine, that this air is highly susceptible of pathos: accordingly, you
will soon hear him at your concert try it to a song of mine in the
Museum, &#8220;Ye banks and braes o&#8217; bonnie Doon.&#8221; One song more and I have
done; &#8220;Auld lang syne.&#8221; The air is but mediocre; but the following
song, the old song of the olden times, and which has never been in
print, nor even in manuscript, until I took it down from an old man&#8217;s
singing, is enough to recommend any air.<a name="FNanchor_246_246" id="FNanchor_246_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a></p>

<p>Now, I suppose, I have tried your patience fairly. You must, after all
is over, have a number of ballads, properly so called. &#8220;Gil Morice,&#8221;
&#8220;Tranent Muir,&#8221; &#8220;Macpherson&#8217;s farewell,&#8221; &#8220;Battle of Sherriff-muir,&#8221;
or, &#8220;We ran, and they ran,&#8221; (I know the author of this charming
ballad, and his history,) &#8220;Hardiknute,&#8221; &#8220;Barbara Allan&#8221; (I can furnish
a finer set of this tune than any that has yet appeared;) and besides
do you know that I really have the old tune to which &#8220;The cherry and
the slae&#8221; was sung, and which is mentioned as a well-known air in
&#8220;Scotland&#8217;s Complaint,&#8221; a book published before poor Mary&#8217;s days?<a name="FNanchor_247_247" id="FNanchor_247_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a>
It was then called &#8220;The banks of Helicon;&#8221; an old poem which Pinkerton
has brought to light. You will see all this in Tytler&#8217;s history of
Scottish music. The tune, to a learned ear, may have no great merit;
but it is a great curiosity. I have a good many original things of
this kind.</p>

<h3>TO MR. THOMSON.</h3>

<p>[Burns listened too readily to the suggestion of Thomson, to alter
&#8220;Bruce&#8217;s Address to his troops at Bannockburn:&#8221; whatever may be the
merits of the air of &#8220;Louis Gordon,&#8221; the sublime simplicity of the
words was injured by the alteration: it is now sung as originally
written, by all singers of taste.]</p>

<p>I am happy, my dear Sir, that my ode pleases you so much. Your idea,
&#8220;honour&#8217;s bed,&#8221; is, though a beautiful, a hackneyed idea; so, if you
please, we will let the line stand as it is. I have altered the song
as follows:&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_248_248" id="FNanchor_248_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a></p>

<h3>TO MR. THOMSON.</h3>

<p>[The poet&#8217;s good sense rose at last in arms against the criticisms of
the musician, and he refused to lessen the dignity of his war-ode by
any more alterations.]</p>

<p class="sig"><i>September, 1793.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;Who shall decide when doctors disagree?&#8221; My ode pleases me so much
that I cannot alter it. Your proposed alterations would, in my
opinion, make it tame. I am exceedingly obliged to you for putting me
on reconsidering it, as I think I have much improved it. Instead of
&#8220;sodger! hero!&#8221; I will have it &#8220;Caledonian, on wi&#8217; me!&#8221;</p>

<p>I have scrutinized it over and over; and to the world, some way or
other, it shall go as it is. At the same time it will not in the least
hurt me, should you leave it out altogether, and adhere to your first
intention of adopting Logan&#8217;s verses.</p>

<p>I have finished my song to &#8220;Saw ye my father?&#8221; and in English, as you
will see. That there is a syllable too much for the expression of the
air, is true; but, allow me to say, that the mere dividing of a dotted
crotchet into a crotchet and a quaver, is not a great matter: however,
in that I have no pretensions to cope in judgment with you. Of the
poetry I speak <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[471]</a></span>
with confidence; but the music is a business where I hint my ideas
with the utmost diffidence.</p>

<p>The old verses have merit, though unequal, and are popular: my advice
is to set the air to the old words, and let mine follow as English
verses. Here they are:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

and &#8220;There&#8217;s nae luck about the house,&#8221; Burns puts in a word of
praise, from a feeling that Thomson&#8217;s taste would induce him to
exclude the first&mdash;one of our most original songs&mdash;from his
collection.]</p>

<p class="sig"><i>September, 1793.</i></p>

<p>I have been turning over some volumes of songs, to find verses whose
measures would suit the airs for which you have allotted me to find
English songs.</p>

<p>For &#8220;Muirland Willie,&#8221; you have, in Ramsay&#8217;s Tea-Table, an excellent
song beginning, &#8220;Ah, why those tears in Nelly&#8217;s eyes?&#8221; As for &#8220;The
Collier&#8217;s Dochter,&#8221; take the following old bacchanal:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;Deluded swain, the pleasure, &amp;c.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_250_250" id="FNanchor_250_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The faulty line in Logan-Water, I mend thus:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">How can your flinty hearts enjoy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The widow&#8217;s tears, the orphan&#8217;s cry?<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The song otherwise will pass. As to &#8220;M&#8217;Gregoira Rua-Ruth,&#8221; you will
see a song of mine to it, with a set of the air superior to yours, in
the Museum, vol. ii. p. 181. The song begins,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Raving winds around her blowing.<a name="FNanchor_251_251" id="FNanchor_251_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Your Irish airs are pretty, but they are rank Irish. If they were like
the &#8220;Banks of Banna,&#8221; for instance, though really Irish, yet in the
Scottish taste, you might adopt them. Since you are so fond of Irish
music, what say you to twenty-five of them in an additional number? We
could easily find this quantity of charming airs; I will take care
that you shall not want songs; and I assure you that you would find it
the most saleable of the whole. If you do not approve of &#8220;Roy&#8217;s wife,&#8221;
for the music&#8217;s sake, we shall not insert it. &#8220;Deil tak the wars&#8221; is a
charming song; so is, &#8220;Saw ye my Peggy?&#8221; &#8220;There&#8217;s nae luck about the
house&#8221; well deserves a place. I cannot say that &#8220;O&#8217;er the hills and
far awa&#8221; strikes me as equal to your selection. &#8220;This is no my ain
house,&#8221; is a great favourite air of mine; and if you will send me your
set of it, I will task my muse to her highest effort. What is your
opinion of &#8220;I hae laid a herrin&#8217; in saut?&#8221; I like it much. Your
jacobite airs are pretty, and there are many others of the same kind
pretty; but you have not room for them. You cannot, I think, insert
&#8220;Fy! let&#8217;s a&#8217; to the bridal,&#8221; to any other words than its own.</p>

<p>What pleases me, as simple and <i>naive</i>, disgusts you as ludicrous and
low. For this reason, &#8220;Fy! gie me my coggie, Sirs,&#8221; &#8220;Fy let&#8217;s a&#8217; to
the bridal,&#8221; with several others of that cast, are to me highly
pleasing; while &#8220;Saw ye my father, or saw ye my mother?&#8221; delights me
with its descriptive simple pathos. Thus my song, &#8220;Ken ye what Meg o&#8217;
the mill has gotten?&#8221; pleases myself so much, that I cannot try my
hand at another song to the air, so I shall not attempt it. I know you
will laugh at all this: but &#8220;ilka man wears his belt his ain gait.&#8221;</p>

<p>[Of the Hon. Andrew Erskine an account was communicated in a letter to

talent, and joint projector of Thomson&#8217;s now celebrated work.]</p>

<p class="sig"><i>October, 1793.</i></p>

<p>Your last letter, my dear Thomson, was indeed laden with heavy news.
Alas, poor Erskine!<a name="FNanchor_252_252" id="FNanchor_252_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a> The recollection that he was a co-adjutator in

<p>I am pleased that you are reconciled to the air of the &#8220;Quaker&#8217;s
wife;&#8221; though, by the bye, an old Highland gentleman, and a deep
antiquarian, tells me it is a Gaelic air, and known by the name of

<p>Your objection to the English song I proposed for &#8220;John Anderson my

think is so much in your favour. The more original good poetry your

<p>The following address of Turnbull&#8217;s to the Nightingale will suit as an

you like his manner. Possibly, as he is an old friend of mine, I may
be prejudiced in his favour; but I like some of his pieces very much.</p>

<p>[The collection of songs alluded to in this letter, are only known to
the curious in loose lore: they were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[473]</a></span> printed by an obscure

<p>&#8217;Tis said that we take the greatest liberties with our greatest
friends, and I pay myself a very high compliment in the manner in
which I am going to apply the remark. I have owed you money longer
than ever I owed it to any man. Here is Kerr&#8217;s account, and here are
the six guineas; and now I don&#8217;t owe a shilling to man&mdash;or woman
either. But for these d&mdash;&mdash;d dirty, dog&#8217;s-ear&#8217;d little pages,<a name="FNanchor_255_255" id="FNanchor_255_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a> I
had done myself the honour to have waited on you long ago. Independent
of the obligations your hospitality has laid me under, the
consciousness of your superiority in the rank of man and gentleman, of
itself was fully as much as I could ever make head against; but to owe
you money too, was more than I could face.</p>

<p>I think I once mentioned something to you of a collection of Scots
songs I have for some years been making: I send you a perusal of what
I have got together. I could not conveniently spare them above five or
six days, and five or six glances of them will probably more than
suffice you. When you are tired of them, please leave them with Mr.
Clint, of the King&#8217;s Arms. There is not another copy of the collection
in the world; and I should be sorry that any unfortunate negligence
should deprive me of what has cost me a good deal of pains.</p>

<p>Heated as I was with wine yesternight, I was perhaps rather seemingly
impertinent in my anxious wish to be honoured with your acquaintance.
You will forgive it: it was the impulse of heart-felt respect. &#8220;He is
the father of the Scottish county reform, and is a man who does honour
to the business, at the same time that the business does honour to
him,&#8221; said my worthy friend Glenriddel to somebody by me who was
talking of your coming to this county with your corps. &#8220;Then,&#8221; I said,
&#8220;I have a woman&#8217;s longing to take him by the hand, and say to him,
&#8216;Sir, I honour you as a man to whom the interests of humanity are
dear, and as a patriot to whom the rights of your country are
sacred.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>In times like these, Sir, when our commoners are barely able by the
glimmer of their own twilight understandings to scrawl a frank, and
when lords are what gentlemen would be ashamed to be, to whom shall a
sinking country call for help? To the independent country gentleman.
To him who has too deep a stake in his country not to be in earnest
for her welfare; and who in the honest pride of a man can view with
equal contempt the insolence of office and the allurements of
corruption.</p>

<p>I mentioned to you a Scots ode or song I had lately composed, and
which I think has some merit. Allow me to enclose it. When I fall in
with you at the theatre, I shall be glad to have your opinion of it.
Accept it, Sir, as a very humble but most sincere tribute of respect
from a man, who, dear as he prizes poetic fame, yet holds dearer an
independent mind.</p>

pleasure to know Mr. G. well. His merit as an actor is generally
acknowledged. He has genius and worth which would do honour to
patronage: he is a poor and modest man; claims which from their very

for pity! that from the indolence of those who have the good things of

snatch that boon, the rightful due of retiring, humble want! Of all

acquaintance with which you have been pleased to honour me?
Independent of my enthusiasm as a Scotsman, I have rarely met with
anything in history which interests my feelings as a man, equal with
the story of Bannockburn. On the one hand, a cruel, but able usurper,
leading on the finest army in Europe to extinguish the last spark of
freedom among a greatly-daring and greatly-injured people; on the
other hand, the desperate relics of a gallant nation, devoting
themselves to rescue their bleeding country, or perish with her.</p>

thou be too dearly bought!</p>

<h3>TO JOHN SYME, ESQ.</h3>

<p>[John Syme, of the stamp-office, was the companion as well as comrade

company, and sinned in rhyme now and then: his epigrams were often

<p>You know that among other high dignities, you have the honour to be my
supreme court of critical judicature, from which there is no appeal. I
enclose you a song which I composed since I saw you, and I am going to
give you the history of it. Do you know that among much that I admire
in the characters and manners of those great folks whom I have now the
honour to call my acquaintances, the Oswald family, there is nothing
charms me more than Mr. Oswald&#8217;s unconcealable attachment to that
incomparable woman. Did you ever, my dear Syme, meet with a man who
owed more to the Divine Giver of all good things than Mr. O.? A fine
fortune; a pleasing exterior; self-evident amiable dispositions, and
an ingenuous upright mind, and that informed, too, much beyond the
usual run of young fellows of his rank and fortune: and to all this,
such a woman!&mdash;but of her I shall say nothing at all, in despair of
saying anything adequate: in my song I have endeavoured to do justice
to what would be his feelings, on seeing, in the scene I have drawn,
the habitation of his Lucy. As I am a good deal pleased with my
performance, I, in my first fervour, thought of sending it to Mrs.
Oswald, but on second thoughts, perhaps what I offer as the honest
incense of genuine respect, might, from the well-known character of
poverty and poetry, be construed into some modification or other of
that servility which my soul abhors.</p>

<p class="sig7"><span class="smcap">Madam</span>,</p>

<p>Nothing short of a kind of absolute necessity could have made me
trouble you with this letter. Except my ardent and just esteem for
your sense, taste, and worth, every sentiment arising in my breast, as
I put pen to paper to you, is painful. The scenes I have passed with
the friend of my soul and his amiable connexions! the wrench at my
heart to think that he is gone, for ever gone from me, never more to
meet in the wanderings of a weary world! and the cutting reflection of
all, that I had most unfortunately, though most undeservedly, lost the
confidence of that soul of worth, ere it took its flight!</p>

<p>These, Madam, are sensations of no ordinary anguish.&mdash;However, you
also may be offended with some <i>imputed</i> improprieties of mine;
sensibility you know I possess, and sincerity none will deny me.</p>

<p>To oppose those prejudices which have been raised against me, is not
the business of this letter. Indeed it is a warfare I know not how to
wage. The powers of positive vice I can in some degree calculate, and
against direct malevolence I can be on my guard; but who can estimate
the fatuity of giddy caprice, or ward off the unthinking mischief of
precipitate folly?</p>

<p>I have a favour to request of you, Madam, and of your sister Mrs. &mdash;&mdash;,
through your means. You know that, at the wish of my late friend, I
made a collection of all my trifles in verse which I had ever written.
They are many of them local, some of them puerile and silly, and all
of them unfit for the public eye. As I have some little fame at stake,
a fame that I trust may live when the hate of those who &#8220;watch for my
halting,&#8221; and the contumelious sneer of those whom accident has made
my superiors, will, with themselves, be gone to the regions of
oblivion; I am uneasy now for the fate of those manuscripts&mdash;Will
Mrs. &mdash;&mdash; have the goodness to destroy them, or return them to me? As a
pledge of friendship they were bestowed; and that circumstance indeed
was all their merit. Most unhappily for me, that merit they no longer
possess; and I hope that Mrs. &mdash;&mdash; &#8216;s goodness, which I well know, and
ever will revere, will not refuse this favour to a man whom she once
held in some degree of estimation.</p>

only be envied by a reprobate spirit listening to the sentence that
dooms it to perdition.</p>

<p>Are you deep in the language of consolation? I have exhausted in
reflection every topic of comfort. <i>A heart at ease</i> would have been
charmed with my sentiments and reasonings; but as to myself I was like
Judas Iscariot preaching the gospel; he might melt and mould the
hearts of those around him, but his own kept its native
incorrigibility.</p>

<p>Still there are two great pillars that bear us up, amid the wreck of
misfortune and misery. The one is composed of the different
modifications of a certain noble stubborn something in man, known by
the names of courage, fortitude,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[478]</a></span> magnanimity. The other is made up of
those feelings and sentiments, which, however the sceptic may deny
them, or the enthusiast disfigure them, are yet, I am convinced,
original and component parts of the human soul; those <i>senses of the
mind</i>, if I may be allowed the expression, which connect us with, and
link us to, those awful, obscure realities&mdash;an all-powerful, and
equally beneficent God; and a world to come, beyond death and the
grave. The first gives the nerve of combat, while a ray of hope beams
on the field: the last pours the balm of comfort into the wounds which
time can never cure.</p>

<p>I do not remember, my dear Cunningham, that you and I ever talked on
the subject of religion at all. I know some who laugh at it, as the
trick of the crafty few, to lead the undiscerning <span class="smcap">many</span>; or at
most as an uncertain obscurity, which mankind can never know anything
of, and with which they are fools if they give themselves much to do.
Nor would I quarrel with a man for his irreligion, any more than I
would for his want of a musical ear. I would regret that he was shut
out from what, to me and to others, were such superlative sources of
enjoyment. It is in this point of view, and for this reason, that I
will deeply imbue the mind of every child of mine with religion. If my
son should happen to be a man of feeling, sentiment, and taste, I
shall thus add largely to his enjoyments. Let me flatter myself that
this sweet little fellow, who is just now running about my desk, will
be a man of a melting, ardent, glowing heart; and an imagination,
delighted with the painter, and rapt with the poet. Let me figure him
wandering out in a sweet evening, to inhale the balmy gales, and enjoy
the growing luxuriance of spring; himself the while in the blooming
youth of life. He looks abroad on all nature, and through nature up to
nature&#8217;s God. His soul, by swift delighting degrees, is rapt above
this sublunary sphere, until he can be silent no longer, and bursts
out into the glorious enthusiasm of Thomson,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;These, as they change, Almighty Father, these<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are but the varied God.&mdash;The rolling year<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is full of thee.&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And so on, in all the spirit and ardour of that charming hymn. These
are no ideal pleasures, they are real delights; and I ask what of the
delights among the sons of men are superior, not to say equal to them?
And they have this precious, vast addition, that conscious virtue
stamps them for her own; and lays hold on them to bring herself into
the presence of a witnessing, judging, and approving God.</p>

<h3>TO THE EARL OF GLENCAIRN.</h3>

<p>[The original letter is in the possession of the Hon. Mrs. Halland, of

to have been written in May, 1794.]</p>

<p>When you cast your eye on the name at the bottom of this letter, and
on the title-page of the book I do myself the honour to send your
lordship, a more pleasurable feeling than my vanity tells me that it
must be a name not entirely unknown to you. The generous patronage of
your late illustrious brother found me in the lowest obscurity: he
introduced my rustic muse to the partiality of my country; and to him
I owe all. My sense of his goodness, and the anguish of my soul at
losing my truly noble protector and friend, I have endeavoured to
express in a poem to his memory, which I have now published. This
edition is just from the press; and in my gratitude to the dead, and
my respect for the living (fame belies you, my lord, if you possess
not the same dignity of man, which was your noble brother&#8217;s
characteristic feature), I had destined a copy for the Earl of
Glencairn. I learnt just now that you are in town:&mdash;allow me to
present it you.</p>

<p>I know, my lord, such is the vile, venal contagion which pervades the
world of letters, that professions of respect from an author,
particularly from a poet, to a lord, are more than suspicious. I claim
my by-past conduct, and my feelings at this moment, as exceptions to
the too just conclusion. Exalted as are the honours of your lordship&#8217;s
name, and unnoted as is the obscurity of mine; with the uprightness of
an honest man, I come before your lordship with an offering, however
humble, &#8217;tis all I have to give, of my grateful respect; and to beg of
you, my lord,&mdash;&#8217;tis all I have to ask of you,&mdash;that you will do me the
honour to accept of it.</p>

<p>I return you the plates, with which I am highly pleased; I would
humbly propose, instead of the younker knitting stockings, to put a

ablest judge on the subject I have ever met with, and, though an

with Allan&#8217;s manner. I got him a peep of the &#8220;Gentle Shepherd;&#8221; and he
pronounces Allan a most original artist of great excellence.</p>

<p>For my part, I look on Mr. Allan&#8217;s choosing my favourite poem for his

<p>I am quite vexed at Pleyel&#8217;s being cooped up in France, as it will put
an entire stop to our work. Now, and for six or seven months, I shall
be quite in song, as you shall see by and bye. I got an air, pretty
enough, composed by Lady Elizabeth Heron, of Heron, which she calls
&#8220;The Banks of Cree.&#8221; Cree is a beautiful romantic stream; and, as her

<p>[Castle Douglas is a thriving Galloway village: it was in other days

England, and America.]</p>

Howard&#8217;s favourite idea of reclaiming sinners; so let me consider by

<p>I am just going to trouble your critical patience with the first

<p class="sig7"><span class="smcap">My dear Friend</span>,</p>

<p>You should have heard from me long ago; but over and above some
vexatious share in the pecuniary losses of these accursed times, I
have all this winter been plagued with low spirits and blue devils, so
that <i>I have almost hung my harp on the willow-trees.</i></p>

<p>I am just now busy correcting a new edition of my poems, and this,
with my ordinary business, finds me in full employment.</p>

<p>I send you by my friend Mr. Wallace forty-one songs for your fifth
volume; if we cannot finish it in any other way, what would you think
of Scots words to some beautiful Irish airs? In the mean time, at your
leisure, give a copy of the Museum to my worthy friend, Sir. Peter
Hill, bookseller, to bind for me, interleaved with blank leaves,
exactly as he did the Laird of Glenriddel&#8217;s, that I may insert every
anecdote I can learn, together with my own criticisms and remarks on
the songs. A copy of this kind I shall leave with you, the editor, to
publish at some after period, by way of making the Museum a book
famous to the end of time, and you renowned for ever.</p>

<p>I have got an Highland dirk, for which I have great veneration; as it
once was the dirk of <i>Lord Balmerino.</i> It fell into bad hands, who
stripped it of the silver mounting, as well as the knife and fork. I
have some thoughts of sending it to your care, to get it mounted anew.</p>

<p>Thank you for the copies of my Volunteer Ballad.&mdash;Our friend Clarke
has done <i>indeed</i> well! &#8217;tis chaste and beautiful. I have not met with

<p>The last evening, as I was straying out, and thinking of &#8220;O&#8217;er the

my spinning will deserve to be laid up in store, like the precious

manufacture of the spider, I leave, my dear Sir, to your usual candid
criticism. I was pleased with several lines in it at first, but I own
that now it appears rather a flimsy business.</p>

<p>This is just a hasty sketch, until I see whether it be worth a

<p>I shall withdraw my &#8220;On the seas and far away&#8221; altogether: it is
unequal, and unworthy the work. Making a poem is like begetting a son:
you cannot know whether you have a wise man or a fool, until you
produce him to the world to try him.</p>

<p>For that reason I send you the offspring of my brain, abortions and
all; and, as such, pray look over them, and forgive them, and burn
them. I am flattered at your adopting &#8220;Ca&#8217; the yowes to the knowes,&#8221;
as it was owing to me that ever it saw the light. About seven years
ago I was well acquainted with a worthy little fellow of a clergyman,
a Mr. Clunie, who sang it charmingly; and, at my request, Mr. Clarke
took it down from his singing. When I gave it to Johnson, I added some
stanzas to the song, and mended others, but still it will not do for
you. In a solitary stroll which I took to-day, I tried my hand on a
few pastoral lines, following up the idea of the chorus, which I would
preserve. Here it is, with all its crudities and imperfections on its

<p>Do you know a blackguard Irish song called &#8220;Onagh&#8217;s Waterfall?&#8221; The
air is charming, and I have often regretted the want of decent verses
to it. It is too much, at least for my humble rustic muse, to expect
that every effort of hers shall have merit; still I think that it is
better to have mediocre verses to a favourite air, than none at all.
On this principle I have all along proceeded in the Scots Musical
Museum; and as that publication is at its last volume, I intend the
following song, to the air above mentioned, for that work.</p>

<p>If it does not suit you as an editor, you may be pleased to have
verses to it that you can sing in the company of ladies.</p>

<p>Not to compare small things with great, my taste in music is like the
mighty Frederick of Prussia&#8217;s taste in painting: we are told that he
frequently admired what the connoisseurs decried, and always without
any hypocrisy confessed his admiration. I am sensible that my taste in
music must be inelegant and vulgar, because people of undisputed and
cultivated taste can find no merit in my favourite tunes. Still,
because I am cheaply pleased, is that any reason why I should deny
myself that pleasure? Many of our strathspeys, ancient and modern,
give me most exquisite enjoyment, where you and other judges would
probably be showing disgust. For instance, I am just now making verses
for &#8220;Rothemurche&#8217;s rant,&#8221; an air which puts me in raptures; and, in
fact, unless I be pleased with the tune, I never can make verses to
it. Here I have Clarke on my side, who is a judge that I will pit
against any of you. &#8220;Rothemurche,&#8221; he says, &#8220;is an air both original
and beautiful;&#8221; and, on his recommendation, I have taken the first
part of the tune for a chorus, and the fourth or last part for the
song. I am but two stanzas deep in the work, and possibly you may
think, and justly, that the poetry is as little worth your attention
as the music.</p>

<p>[Here follow two stanzas of the song, beginning &#8220;Lassie wi&#8217; the
lint-white locks.&#8221; Song <a href="#CCXXXIII">CCXXXIII.</a>]</p>

<p>I have begun anew, &#8220;Let me in this ae night.&#8221; Do you think that we
ought to retain the old chorus? I think we must retain both the old
chorus and the first stanza of the old song. I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[482]</a></span> do not altogether like
the third line of the first stanza, but cannot alter it to please
myself. I am just three stanzas deep in it. Would you have the
<i>denouement</i> to be successful or otherwise?&mdash;should she &#8220;let him in&#8221;
or not?</p>

<p>Did you not once propose &#8220;The sow&#8217;s tail to Geordie&#8221; as an air for
your work? I am quite delighted with it; but I acknowledge that is no
mark of its real excellence. I once set about verses for it, which I
meant to be in the alternate way of a lover and his mistress chanting
together. I have not the pleasure of knowing Mrs. Thomson&#8217;s Christian
name, and yours, I am afraid, is rather burlesque for sentiment, else
I had meant to have made you the hero and heroine of the little piece.</p>

<p>How do you like the following epigram which I wrote the other day on a
lovely young girl&#8217;s recovery from a fever? Doctor Maxwell was the
physician who seemingly saved her from the grave; and to him I address

<p>By this morning&#8217;s post I have your list, and, in general, I highly
approve of it. I shall, at more leisure, give you a critique on the
whole. Clarke goes to your town by to-day&#8217;s fly, and I wish you would
call on him and take his opinion in general: you know his taste is a
standard. He will return here again in a week or two, so please do not
miss asking for him. One thing I hope he will do&mdash;persuade you to
adopt my favourite &#8220;Craigieburn-wood,&#8221; in your selection: it is as
great a favourite of his as of mine. The lady on whom it was made is
one of the finest women in Scotland; and in fact (<i>entre nous</i>) is in
a manner to me what Sterne&#8217;s Eliza was to him&mdash;a mistress, or friend,
or what you will, in the guileless simplicity of Platonic love. (Now,
don&#8217;t put any of your squinting constructions on this, or have any
clishmaclaver about it among our acquaintances.) I assure you that to
my lovely friend you are indebted for many of your best songs of mine.
Do you think that the sober, gin-horse routine of existence could
inspire a man with life, and love, and joy&mdash;could fire him with
enthusiasm, or melt him with pathos, equal to the genius of your book?
No! no! Whenever I want to be more than ordinary in song&mdash;to be in
some degree equal to your diviner airs&mdash;do you imagine I fast and pray
for the celestial emanation? <i>Tout au contraire!</i> I have a glorious
recipe; the very one that for his own use was invented by the divinity
of healing and poetry, when erst he piped to the flocks of Admetus. I
put myself in a regimen of admiring a fine woman; and in proportion to
the adorability of her charms, in proportion you are delighted with my
verses. The lightning of her eye is the godhead of Parnassus, and the
witchery of her smile the divinity of Helicon!</p>

<p>To descend to business: if you like my idea of &#8220;When she cam ben she
bobbit,&#8221; the following stanzas of mine, altered a little from what
they were formerly, when set to another air, may perhaps do instead of
worse stanzas:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">O saw ye my dear, my Phely.<a name="FNanchor_261_261" id="FNanchor_261_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Now for a few miscellaneous remarks. &#8220;The Posie&#8221; (in the Museum) is my
composition; the air was taken down from Mrs. Burns&#8217;s voice. It is
well known in the west country, but the old words are trash. By the
bye, take a look at the tune again, and tell me if you do not think it
is the original from which &#8220;Roslin Castle&#8221; is composed. The second
part in particular, for the first two or three bars, is exactly the
old air. &#8220;Strathallan&#8217;s Lament&#8221; is mine; the music is by our right
trusty and deservedly well-beloved Allan Masterton. &#8220;Donocht-Head&#8221; is
not mine; I would give ten pounds it were. It appeared first in the
Edinburgh Herald, and came to the editor of that paper with the
Newcastle post-mark on it &#8220;Whistle o&#8217;er the lave o&#8217;t&#8221; is mine: the
music said to be by a John<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[483]</a></span> Bruce, a celebrated violin-player in
Dumfries, about the beginning of this century. This I know, Bruce, who
was an honest man, though a red-wud Highlandman, constantly claimed
it; and by all the old musical people here is believed to be the
author of it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Andrew and his cutty gun.&#8221; The song to which this is set in the
Museum is mine, and was composed on Miss Euphemia Murray, of Lintrose,
commonly and deservedly called the Flower of Strathmore.</p>

<p>&#8220;How long and dreary is the night!&#8221; I met with some such words in a
collection of songs somewhere, which I altered and enlarged; and to
please you, and to suit your favourite air, I have taken a stride or
two across my room, and have arranged it anew, as you will find on the
other page.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">How long and dreary is the night, &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_262_262" id="FNanchor_262_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Tell me how you like this. I differ from your idea of the expression
of the tune. There is, to me, a great deal of tenderness in it. You
cannot, in my opinion, dispense with a bass to your addenda airs. A
lady of my acquaintance, a noted performer, plays and sings at the
same time so charmingly, that I shall never bear to see any of her
songs sent into the world, as naked as Mr. What-d&#8217;ye-call-um has done
in his London collection.<a name="FNanchor_263_263" id="FNanchor_263_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a></p>

<p>These English songs gravel me to death. I have not that command of the
language that I have of my native tongue. I have been at &#8220;Duncan
Gray,&#8221; to dress it in English, but all I can do is deplorably stupid.
For instance:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Let not woman e&#8217;er complain, &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_264_264" id="FNanchor_264_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Since the above, I have been out in the country, taking a dinner with
a friend, where I met with a lady whom I mentioned in the second page
in this odds-and-ends of a letter. As usual, I got into song; and
returning home I composed the following:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Sleep&#8217;st thou, or wak&#8217;st thou, fairest creature
&amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_265_265" id="FNanchor_265_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a></span>
</div></div>

<p>If you honour my verses by setting the air to them, I will vamp up the
old song, and make it English enough to be understood.</p>

<p>I enclose you a musical curiosity, an East Indian air, which you would
swear was a Scottish one. I know the authenticity of it, as the
gentleman who brought it over is a particular acquaintance of mine. Do
preserve me the copy I send you, as it is the only one I have. Clarke
has set a bass to it, and I intend putting it into the Musical Museum.
Here follow the verses I intend for it.</p>

</div></div>

<p>I would be obliged to you if you would procure me a sight of Ritson&#8217;s
collection of English songs, which you mention in your letter. I will
thank you for another information, and that as speedily as you please:
whether this miserable drawling hotch-potch epistle has not completely
tired you of my correspondence?</p>

<h3>TO MR. THOMSON.</h3>

<p>[The presents made to the poet were far from numerous: the book for
which he expresses his thanks, was the work of the waspish Ritson.]</p>

<p class="sig"><i>November, 1794.</i></p>

<p>Many thanks to you, my dear Sir, for your present; it is a book of the
utmost importance to me. I have yesterday begun my anecdotes, &amp;c., for
your work. I intend drawing them up in the form of a letter to you,
which will save<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[484]</a></span> me from the tedious dull business of systematic
arrangement. Indeed, as all I have to say consists of unconnected
remarks, anecdotes, scraps of old songs, &amp;c., it would be impossible
to give the work a beginning, a middle, and an end, which the critics
insist to be absolutely necessary in a work. In my last, I told you my
objections to the song you had selected for &#8220;My lodging is on the cold
ground.&#8221; On my visit the other day to my friend Chloris (that is the
poetic name of the lovely goddess of my inspiration), she suggested an
idea, which I, on my return from the visit, wrought into the following
song.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">My Chloris, mark how green the groves.<a name="FNanchor_267_267" id="FNanchor_267_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>How do you like the simplicity and tenderness of this pastoral? I
think it pretty well.</p>

<p>I like you for entering so candidly and so kindly into the story of
&#8220;<i>ma chere amie.</i>&#8221; I assure you I was never more in earnest in my
life, than in the account of that affair which I sent you in my last.
Conjugal love is a passion which I deeply feel, and highly venerate;
but, somehow, it does not make such a figure in poesy as that other
species of the passion,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;Where love is liberty, and nature law.&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Musically speaking, the first is an instrument of which the gamut is
scanty and confined, but the tones inexpressibly sweet, while the last
has powers equal to all the intellectual modulations of the human
soul. Still, I am a very poet in my enthusiasm of the passion. The
welfare and happiness of the beloved object is the first and inviolate
sentiment that pervades my soul; and whatever pleasures I might wish
for, or whatever might be the raptures they would give me, yet, if
they interfere with that first principle, it is having these pleasures
at a dishonest price; and justice forbids and generosity disdains the
purchase.</p>

<p>Despairing of my own powers to give you variety enough in English
songs, I have been turning over old collections, to pick out songs, of
which the measure is something similar to what I want; and, with a
little alteration, so as to suit the rhythm of the air exactly, to
give you them for your work. Where the songs have hitherto been but
little noticed, nor have ever been set to music, I think the shift a
fair one. A song, which, under the same first verse, you will find in
Ramsay&#8217;s Tea-table Miscellany, I have cut down for an English dress to
your &#8220;Dainty Davie,&#8221; as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">It was the charming month of May.<a name="FNanchor_268_268" id="FNanchor_268_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>You may think meanly of this, but take a look at the bombast original,
and you will be surprised that I have made so much of it. I have
finished my song to &#8220;Rothemurche&#8217;s rant,&#8221; and you have Clarke to
consult as to the set of the air for singing.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Lassie wi&#8217; the lint-white locks, &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_269_269" id="FNanchor_269_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This piece has at least the merit of being a regular pastoral: the
vernal morn, the summer noon, the autumnal evening, and the winter
night, are regularly rounded. If you like it, well; if not, I will
insert it in the Museum.</p>

<h3>TO MR. THOMSON.</h3>

<p>[Sir Walter Scott remarked, on the lyrics of Burns, &#8220;that at last the
writing a series of songs for large musical collections degenerated
into a slavish labour which no talents could support.&#8221;]</p>

<p>I am out of temper that you should set so sweet, so tender an air, as
&#8220;Deil tak the wars,&#8221; to the foolish old verses. You talk of the
silliness of &#8220;Saw ye my father?&#8221;&mdash;By heavens! the odds is gold to
brass! Besides, the old song, though now pretty well modernized into
the Scottish language, is originally, and in the early editions, a
bungling low imitation of the Scottish manner, by that genius Tom
D&#8217;Urfey, so has no pretensions to be a Scottish production. There is a
pretty English song by Sheridan, in the &#8220;Duenna,&#8221; to this air, which
is out of sight superior to D&#8217;Urfey&#8217;s. It begins,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;When sable night each drooping plant restoring.&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The air, if I understand the expression of it properly, is the very
native language of simplicity, tenderness, and love. I have again gone
over my song to the tune.</p>

<p>Now for my English song to &#8220;Nancy&#8217;s to the greenwood,&#8221; &amp;c.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Farewell thou stream that winding flows.<a name="FNanchor_270_270" id="FNanchor_270_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>There is an air, &#8220;The Caledonian Hunt&#8217;s Delight,&#8221; to which I wrote a
song that, you will find in Johnson, &#8220;Ye banks and braes o&#8217; bonnie<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[485]</a></span>
Doon:&#8221; this air I think might find a place among your hundred, as Lear
says of his knights. Do you know the history of the air? It is curious
enough. A good many years ago, Mr. James Miller, writer in your good
town, a gentleman whom possibly you know, was in company with our
friend Clarke; and talking of Scottish music, Miller expressed an
ardent ambition to be able to compose a Scots air. Mr. Clarke, partly
by way of joke, told him to keep to the black keys of the harpsichord,
and preserve some kind of rhythm, and he would infallibly compose a
Scots air. Certain it is that, in a few days, Mr. Miller produced the
rudiments of an air, which Mr. Clarke, with some touches and
corrections, fashioned into the tune in question. Ritson, you know,
has the same story of the black keys; but this account which I have
just given you, Mr. Clarke informed me of several years ago. Now, to
show you how difficult it is to trace the origin of our airs, I have
heard it repeatedly asserted that this was an Irish air; nay, I met
with an Irish gentleman who affirmed he had heard it in Ireland among
the old women; while, on the other hand, a countess informed me, that
the first person who introduced the air into this country, was a
baronet&#8217;s lady of her acquaintance, who took down the notes from an
itinerant piper in the Isle of Man. How difficult, then, to ascertain
the truth respecting our poesy and music! I, myself, have lately seen
a couple of ballads sung through the streets of Dumfries, with my name
at the head of them as the author, though it was the first time I had
ever seen them.</p>

<p>I thank you for admitting &#8220;Craigieburn-wood;&#8221; and I shall take care to
furnish you with a new chorus. In fact, the chorus was not my work,
but a part of some old verses to the air. If I can catch myself in a
more than ordinarily propitious moment, I shall write a new
&#8220;Craigieburn-wood&#8221; altogether. My heart is much in the theme.</p>

<p>I am ashamed, my dear fellow, to make the request; &#8217;tis dunning your
generosity; but in a moment when I had forgotten whether I was rich or
poor, I promised Chloris a copy of your songs. It wrings my honest
pride to write you this; but an ungracious request is doubly so by a
tedious apology. To make you some amends, as soon as I have extracted
the necessary information out of them, I will return you Ritson&#8217;s
volumes.</p>

<p>The lady is not a little proud that she is to make so distinguished a
figure in your collection, and I am not a little proud that I have it
in my power to please her so much. Lucky it is for your patience that
my paper is done, for when I am in a scribbling humour, I know not
when to give over.</p>

<p>[Willy and Phely, in one of the lyrics which this letter contained,
carry on the pleasant bandying of praise till compliments grow scarce,
and the lovers are reduced to silence.]</p>

<p class="sig"><i>19th November, 1794.</i></p>

<p>You see, my dear Sir, what a punctual correspondent I am; though,
indeed, you may thank yourself for the <i>tedium</i> of my letters, as you
have so flattered me on my horsemanship with my favourite hobby, and
have praised the grace of his ambling so much, that I am scarcely ever
off his back. For instance, this morning, though a keen blowing frost,
in my walk before breakfast, I finished my duet, which you were
pleased to praise so much. Whether I have uniformly succeeded, I will
not say; but here it is for you, though it is not an hour old.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">O Philly, happy be the day.<a name="FNanchor_271_271" id="FNanchor_271_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Tell me honestly how you like it, and point out whatever you think
faulty.</p>

<p>I am much pleased with your idea of singing our songs in alternate
stanzas, and regret that you did not hint it to me sooner. In those
that remain, I shall have it in my eye. I remember your objections to
the name Philly, but it is the common abbreviation of Phillis. Sally,
the only other name that suits, has to my ear a vulgarity about it,
which unfits it, for anything except burlesque. The legion of Scottish
poetasters of the day, whom your brother editor, Mr. Ritson, ranks
with me as my coevals, have always mistaken vulgarity for simplicity;
whereas, simplicity is as much <i>eloign&eacute;e</i> from vulgarity on the one
hand, as from affected point and puerile conceit on the other.</p>

<p>I agree with you as to the air, &#8220;Craigieburn-wood,&#8221; that a chorus
would, in some degree, spoil the effect, and shall certainly have
none<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[486]</a></span> in my projected song to it. It is not, however, a case in point
with &#8220;Rothemurche;&#8221; there, as in &#8220;Roy&#8217;s Wife of Aldivalloch,&#8221; a chorus
goes, to my taste, well enough. As to the chorus going first, that is
the case with &#8220;Roy&#8217;s Wife,&#8221; as well as &#8220;Rothemurche.&#8221; In fact, in the
first part of both tunes, the rhythm is so peculiar and irregular, and
on that irregularity depends so much of their beauty, that we must
e&#8217;en take them with all their wildness, and humour the verse
accordingly. Leaving out the starting note in both tunes, has, I
think, an effect that no regularity could counterbalance the want of.</p>

<p class="sig7">
Try,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{Oh Roy&#8217;s wife of Aldivalloch.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{O lassie wi&#8217; the lint-white locks.</p>
<p>
and</p>
<p class="sig7">compare with
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{Roy&#8217;s wife of Aldivalloch.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{Lassie wi the lint-white locks.
</p>

<p>Does not the lameness of the prefixed syllable strike you? In the last
case, with the true furor of genius, you strike at once into the wild
originality of the air; whereas, in the first insipid method, it is
like the grating screw of the pins before the fiddle is brought into
tune. This is my taste; if I am wrong, I beg pardon of the
<i>cognoscenti.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;The Caledonian Hunt&#8221; is so charming, that it would make any subject
in a song go down; but pathos is certainly its native tongue. Scottish
bacchanalians we certainly want, though the few we have are excellent.
For instance, &#8220;Todlin hame,&#8221; is, for wit and humour, an unparalleled
composition; And &#8220;Andrew and his cutty gun&#8221; is the work of a master.
By the way, are you not quite vexed to think that those men of genius,
for such they certainly were, who composed our fine Scottish lyrics,
should be unknown? It has given me many a heart-ache. Apropos to
bacchanalian songs in Scottish, I composed one yesterday, for an air I
like much&mdash;&#8220;Lumps o&#8217; pudding.&#8221;</p>

<p>[The instrument which the poet got from the braes of Athol, seems of
an order as rude and incapable of fine sounds as the whistles which
school-boys make in spring from the smaller boughs of the plane-tree.]</p>

<p>Since yesterday&#8217;s penmanship, I have framed a couple of English
stanzas, by way of an English song to &#8220;Roy&#8217;s Wife.&#8221; You will allow me,
that in this instance my English corresponds in sentiment with the
Scottish.</p>

<p>Well! I think this, to be done in two or three turns across my room,
and with two or three pinches of Irish blackguard, is not so far
amiss. You see I am determined to have my quantum of applause from
somebody.</p>

<p>Tell my friend Allan (for I am sure that we only want the trifling
circumstance of being known to one another, to be the best friends on
earth) that I much suspect he has, in his plates, mistaken the figure
of the stock and horn. I have, at last, gotten one, but it is a very
rude instrument. It is comprised of three parts; the stock, which is
the hinder thigh bone of a sheep, such as you see in a mutton ham; the
horn, which is a common Highland cow&#8217;s horn, cut off at the smaller
end, until the aperture be large enough to admit the stock to be
pushed up through the horn until it be held by the thicker end of the
thigh-bone; and lastly, an oaten reed exactly cut and notched like
that which you see every shepherd boy have, when the corn-stems are
green and full grown. The reed is not made fast in the bone, but is
held by the lips, and plays loose in the smaller end of the stock;
while the stock, with the horn hanging on its larger end, is held by
the hands in playing. The stock has six or seven ventages on the upper
side, and one back-ventage, like the common flute. This of mine was
made by a man from the braes of Athole, and is exactly what the
shepherds wont to use in that country.</p>

<p>However, either it is not quite properly bored in the holes, or else
we have not the art of blowing it rightly; for we can make little of
it. If Mr. Allan chooses, I will send him a sight of mine, as I look
on myself to be a kind of brother-brush with him. &#8220;Pride in poets is
nae sin;&#8221; and I will say it, that I look on Mr. Allan and Mr. Burns to
be the only genuine and real painters of Scottish costume in the
world.</p>

<h3>TO PETER MILLER, JUN., ESQ.,</h3>

<h4>OF DALSWINTON.</h4>

<p>[In a conversation with James Perry, editor of the Morning Chronicle,
Mr. Miller, who was then member for the Dumfries boroughs, kindly
represented the poverty of the poet and the increasing number of his
family: Perry at once offered fifty pounds a year for any
contributions he might choose to make to his newspaper: the reasons
for his refusal are stated in this letter.]</p>

<p class="sig"><i>Dumfries, Nov. 1794.</i></p>

<p class="sig7"><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,</p>

<p>Your offer is indeed truly generous, and most sincerely do I thank you
for it; but in my present situation, I find that I dare not accept it.
You well know my political sentiments; and were I an insular
individual, unconnected with a wife and a family of children, with the
most fervid enthusiasm I would have volunteered my services: I then
could and would have despised all consequences that might have ensued.</p>

<p>My prospect in the Excise is something; at least it is, encumbered as
I am with the welfare, the very existence, of near half-a-score of
helpless individuals, what I dare not sport with.</p>

<p>In the mean time, they are most welcome to my Ode; only, let them
insert it as a thing they have met with by accident and unknown to
me.&mdash;Nay, if Mr. Perry, whose honour, after your character of him, I
cannot doubt; if he will give me an address and channel by which
anything will come safe from those spies with which he may be certain
that his correspondence is beset, I will now and then send him any
bagatelle that I may write. In the present hurry of Europe, nothing
but news and politics will be regarded; but against the days of peace,
which Heaven send soon, my little assistance may perhaps fill up an
idle column of a newspaper. I have long had it in my head to try my
hand in the way of little prose essays, which I propose sending into
the world though the medium of some newspaper; and should these be
worth his while, to these Mr. Perry shall be welcome; and all my
reward shall be, his treating me with his paper, which, by the bye, to
anybody who has the least relish for wit, is a high treat indeed.</p>

<p>I was, I know, drunk last night, but I am sober this morning. From the
expressions Capt. &mdash;&mdash; made use of to me, had I had no-body&#8217;s welfare
to care for but my own, we should certainly have come, according to
the manners of the world, to the necessity of murdering one another
about the business. The words were such as, generally, I believe, end
in a brace of pistols; but I am still pleased to think that I did not
ruin the peace and welfare of a wife and a family of children in a
drunken squabble. Farther, you know that the report of certain
political opinions being mine, has already once before brought me to
the brink of destruction. I dread lest last night&#8217;s business may be
misrepresented in the same way.&mdash;You, I beg, will take care to prevent
it. I tax your wish for Mr. Burns&#8217; welfare with the task of waiting as
soon as possible, on every gentleman who was present, and state this
to him, and, as you please, show him this letter. What, after all, was
the obnoxious toast? &#8220;May our success in the present war be equal to
the justice of our cause.&#8221;&mdash;A toast that the most outrageous frenzy of
loyalty cannot object to. I request and beg that this morning you will
wait on the parties present at the foolish dispute. I shall only add,
that I am truly sorry that a man who stood so high in my estimation as
Mr. &mdash;&mdash;, should use me in the manner in which I conceive he has done.</p>

<p>[In this brief and off-hand way Burns bestows on Thompson one of the
finest songs ever dedicated to the cause of human freedom.]</p>

<p class="sig"><i>January</i>, 1795.</p>

<p>I fear for my songs; however, a few may please, yet originality is a
coy feature in composition, and in a multiplicity of efforts in the
same style, disappears altogether. For these three thousand years, we
poetic folks have been describing the spring, for instance; and as the
spring continues the same, there must soon be a sameness in the
imagery, &amp;c., of these said rhyming folks.</p>

<p>A great critic (Aikin) on songs, says that love and wine are the
exclusive themes for song-writing. The following is on neither
subject, and consequently is no song; but will be allowed, I think, to
be two or three pretty good prose thoughts inverted into rhyme.</p>

<p>You cannot have any idea of the predicament in which I write to you.
In the course of my duty as supervisor (in which capacity I have acted
of late), I came yesternight to this unfortunate, wicked little
village. I have gone forward, but snows of ten feet deep have impeded
my progress: I have tried to &#8220;gae back the gate I cam again,&#8221; but the
same obstacle has shut me up within insuperable bars. To add to my
misfortune, since dinner, a scraper has been torturing catgut, in
sounds that would have insulted the dying agonies of a sow under the
hands of a butcher, and thinks himself, on that very account,
exceeding good company. In fact, I have been in a dilemma, either to
get drunk, to forget these miseries; or to hang myself, to get rid of
them: like a prudent man (a character congenial to my every thought,
word, and deed), I of two evils have chosen the least, and am very
drunk, at your service!</p>

<p>I wrote you yesterday from Dumfries. I had not time then to tell you
all I wanted to say; and, Heaven knows, at present have not capacity.</p>

<p>Do you know an air&mdash;I am sure you must know it&mdash;&#8220;We&#8217;ll gang nae mair
to yon town?&#8221; I think, in slowish time, it would make an excellent
song. I am highly delighted with it; and if you should think it worthy
of your attention, I have a fair dame in my eye to whom I would
consecrate it.</p>

the value of it, being bestowed on a man who has not, by any means,
merited such an instance of kindness. I have shown it to two or three
judges of the first abilities here, and they all agree with me in
classing it as a first-rate production. My phiz is sae kenspeckle,
that the very joiner&#8217;s apprentice, whom Mrs. Burns employed to break
up the parcel (I was out of town that day) knew it at once. My most
grateful compliments to Allan, who has honoured my rustic music so
much with his masterly pencil. One strange coincidence is, that the
little one who is making the felonious attempt on the cat&#8217;s tail, is
the most striking likeness of an ill-deedie, d&mdash;n&#8217;d, wee,

wickedness, and man-fu&#8217; mischief, which, even at twa days auld, I

<h3>TO MRS. RIDDEL.</h3>

<p><i>Supposes himself to be writing from the dead to the living.</i></p>

<p>[Ill health, poverty, a sense of dependence, with the much he had
deserved of his country, and the little he had obtained, were all at
this time pressing on the mind of Burns, and inducing him to forget
what was due to himself as well as to the courtesies of life.]</p>

<p class="sig7"><span class="smcap">Madam</span>,</p>

<p>I dare say that this is the first epistle you ever received from this
nether world. I write you from the regions of Hell, amid the horrors
of the damned. The time and the manner of my leaving your earth I do
not exactly know, as I took my departure in the heat of a fever of
intoxication contracted at your too hospitable mansion; but, on my
arrival here, I was fairly tried, and sentenced to endure the
purgatorial tortures of this infernal confine for the space of
ninety-nine years, eleven months, and twenty-nine days, and all on
account of the impropriety of my conduct yesternight under your roof.
Here am I, laid on a bed of pitiless furze, with my aching head
reclined on a pillow of ever-piercing thorn, while an infernal
tormentor, wrinkled, and old, and cruel, his name I think is
<i>Recollection</i>, with a whip of scorpions, forbids peace or rest to
approach me, and keeps anguish eternally awake. Still, Madam, if I
could in any measure be reinstated in the good opinion of the fair
circle whom my conduct last night<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[491]</a></span> so much injured, I think it would
be an alleviation to my torments. For this reason I trouble you with
this letter. To the men of the company I will make no apology.&mdash;Your
husband, who insisted on my drinking more than I chose, has no right
to blame me; and the other gentlemen were partakers of my guilt. But
to you, Madam, I have much to apologize. Your good opinion I valued as
one of the greatest acquisitions I had made on earth, and I was truly
a beast to forfeit it. There was a Miss I&mdash;&mdash;, too, a woman of fine
sense, gentle and unassuming manners&mdash;do make on my part, a miserable
d&mdash;mned wretch&#8217;s best apology to her. A Mrs. G&mdash;&mdash;, a charming woman,
did me the honour to be prejudiced in my favour; this makes me hope
that I have not outraged her beyond all forgiveness.&mdash;To all the other
ladies please present my humblest contrition for my conduct, and my
petition for their gracious pardon. O all ye powers of decency and
decorum! whisper to them that my errors, though great, were
involuntary&mdash;that an intoxicated man is the vilest of beasts&mdash;that it
was not in my nature to be brutal to any one&mdash;that to be rude to a
woman, when in my senses, was impossible with me&mdash;but&mdash;</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Regret! Remorse! Shame! ye three hell-hounds that ever dog my steps
and bay at my heels, spare me! spare me!</p>

slave.</p>

<h3>TO MRS. RIDDEL.</h3>

<p>[Mrs. Riddel, it is said, possessed many more of the poet&#8217;s letters
than are printed&mdash;she sometimes read them to friends who could feel
their wit, and, like herself, make allowance for their freedom.]</p>

<p class="sig"><i>Dumfries, 1795.</i></p>

<p>Mr. Burns&#8217;s compliments to Mrs. Riddel&mdash;is much obliged to her for her
polite attention in sending him the book. Owing to Mr. B.&#8217;s being at
present acting as supervisor of excise, a department that occupies his
every hour of the day, he has not that time to spare which is
necessary for any belle-lettre pursuit; but, as he will, in a week or
two, again return to his wonted leisure, he will then pay that
attention to Mrs. R.&#8217;s beautiful song, &#8220;To thee, loved Nith&#8221;&mdash;which it
so well deserves. When &#8220;Anacharsis&#8217; Travels&#8221; come to hand, which Mrs.
Riddel mentioned as her gift to the public library, Mr. B. will thank
her for a reading of it previous to her sending it to the library, as
it is a book Mr. B. has never seen: he wishes to have a longer perusal
of them than the regulations of the library allow.</p>

<p class="sig"><i>Friday Eve.</i></p>

<p>P.S. Mr. Burns will be much obliged to Mrs. Riddel if she will favour
him with a perusal of any of her poetical pieces which he may not have
seen.</p>

<h3>TO MISS LOUISA FONTENELLE.</h3>

<p>[That Miss Fontenelle, as an actress, did not deserve the high praise
which Burns bestows may be guessed: the lines to which he alludes were
recited by the lady on her benefit-night, and are printed among his
Poems.]</p>

<p class="sig7"><span class="smcap">Madam</span>,</p>

<p>In such a bad world as ours, those who add to the scanty sum of our
pleasures, are positively our benefactors. To you, Madam, on our
humble Dumfries boards, I have been more indebted for entertainment
than ever I was in prouder theatres. Your charms as a woman would
insure applause to the most indifferent actress, and your theatrical
talents would insure admiration to the plainest figure. This, Madam,
is not the unmeaning or insidious compliment of the frivolous or
interested; I pay it from the same honest impulse that the sublime of
nature excites my admiration, or her beauties give me delight.</p>

<p>Will the foregoing lines be of any service to you in your approaching
benefit-night? If they will I shall be prouder of my muse than ever.
They are nearly extempore: I know they have no great merit; but though
they should add but little to the entertainment of the evening, they
give me the happiness of an opportunity to declare how much I have the
honour to be, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="sig"><i>15th December, 1795.</i></p>

<p class="sig7"><span class="smcap">My dear Friend</span>,</p>

<p>As I am in a complete Decemberish humour, gloomy, sullen, stupid as
even the Deity of Dulness herself could wish, I shall not drawl out a
heavy letter with a number of heavier apologies for my late silence.
Only one I shall mention, because I know you will sympathize in it:
these four months, a sweet little girl, my youngest child, has been so
ill, that every day, a week or less, threatened to terminate her
existence. There had much need be many pleasures annexed to the states
of husband and father, for, God knows, they have many peculiar cares.
I cannot describe to you the anxious, sleepless hours these ties
frequently give me. I see a train of helpless little folks; me and my
exertions all their stay: and on what a brittle thread does the life
of man hang! If I am nipt off at the command of fate! even in all the
vigour of manhood as I am&mdash;such things happen every day&mdash;gracious God!
what would become of my little flock! &#8217;Tis here that I envy your
people of fortune.&mdash;A father on his death-bed, taking an everlasting
leave of his children, has indeed woe enough; but the man of competent
fortune leaves his sons and daughters independency and friends; while
I&mdash;but I shall run distracted if I think any longer on the subject!</p>

<p>To leave talking of the matter so gravely, I shall sing with the old
Scots ballad&mdash;</p>

<p>We have had a brilliant theatre here this season; only, as all other
business does, it experiences a stagnation of trade from the
epidemical complaint of the country, <i>want of cash.</i> I mentioned our
theatre merely to lug in an occasional Address which I wrote for the
benefit-night of one of the actresses, and which is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<h4>ADDRESS,</h4>
<h5>SPOKEN BY MISS FONTENELLE ON HER BENEFIT-NIGHT, <br />
DEC. 4, 1795, AT
  THE THEATRE, DUMFRIES.</h5>
<p>Still anxious to secure your partial favour, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="sig"><i>25th, Christmas-Morning.</i></p>

<p>This, my much-loved friend, is a morning of wishes&mdash;accept mine&mdash;so
heaven hear me as they are sincere! that blessings may attend your
steps, and affliction know you not! In the charming words of my
favourite author, &#8220;The Man of Feeling,&#8221; &#8220;May the Great Spirit bear up
the weight of thy gray hairs, and blunt the arrow that brings them
rest!&#8221;</p>

<p>Now that I talk of authors, how do you like Cowper? Is not the &#8220;Task&#8221;
a glorious poem? The religion of the &#8220;Task,&#8221; bating a few scraps of
Calvinistic divinity, is the religion of God and nature; the religion
that exalts, that ennobles man. Were not you to send me your &#8220;Zeluco,&#8221;
in return for mine? Tell me how you like my marks and notes through
the book. I would not give a farthing for a book, unless I were at
liberty to blot it with my criticisms.</p>

<p>I have lately collected, for a friend&#8217;s perusal, all my letters; I
mean those which I first sketched, in a rough draught, and afterwards
wrote out fair. On looking over some old musty papers, which, from
time to time, I had parcelled by, as trash that were scarce worth
preserving, and which yet at the same time I did not care to destroy;
I discovered many of these rude sketches, and have written, and am
writing them out, in a bound MS. for my friend&#8217;s library. As I wrote
always to you the rhapsody of the moment, I cannot find a single
scroll to you, except one about the commencement of our acquaintance.
If there were any possible conveyance, I would send you a perusal of
my book.</p>

promised me to make it right, if you will have the goodness to show
him how. As I have no copy of the scheme for myself, and the
alterations being very considerable from what it was formerly, I hope
that I shall have access to this scheme I send you, when I come to
face up my new books. <i>So much for schemes.</i>&mdash;And that no scheme to
betray a <span class="smcap">friend</span>, or mislead a <span class="smcap">stranger</span>; to seduce a

<h3>TO THE EDITOR OF THE MORNING CHRONICLE.</h3>

<p>[Cromek says, when a neighbour complained that his copy of the Morning

poet wrote the following indignant letter to Perry on a leaf of his
excise-book, but before it went to the post he reflected and recalled
it.]</p>

<p class="sig7"><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>

<p>You will see by your subscribers&#8217; list, that I have been about nine
months of that number.</p>

<p>I am sorry to inform you, that in that time, seven or eight of your
papers either have never been sent to me, or else have never reached
me. To be deprived of any one number of the first newspaper in Great
Britain for information, ability, and independence, is what I can ill
brook and bear; but to be deprived of that most admirable oration of
the Marquis of Lansdowne, when he made the great though ineffectual
attempt (in the language of the poet, I fear too true), &#8220;to save a
<span class="smcap">sinking state</span>&#8221;&mdash;this was a loss that I neither can nor will
forgive you.&mdash;That paper, Sir, never reached me; but I demand it of
you. I am a <span class="smcap">Briton</span>; and must be interested in the cause of
<span class="smcap">liberty</span>:&mdash;I am a <span class="smcap">man</span>; and the <span class="smcap">rights</span> of
<span class="smcap">human nature</span> cannot be indifferent to me. However, do not let
me mislead you: I am not a man in that situation of life, which, as
your subscriber, can be of any consequence to you, in the eyes of
those to whom <span class="smcap">situation of life alone</span> is the criterion of
<span class="smcap">man</span>.&mdash;I am but a plain tradesman, in this distant, obscure
country town: but that humble domicile in which I shelter my wife and
children is the <span class="smcap">Castellum</span> of a <span class="smcap">Briton</span>; and that
scanty, hard-earned income which supports them is as truly my
property, as the most magnificent fortune, of the most <span class="smcap">puissant
member</span> of your <span class="smcap">house</span> of <span class="smcap">nobles</span>.</p>

<p>These, Sir, are my sentiments; and to them I subscribe my name: and
were I a man of ability and consequence enough to address the PUBLIC,
with that name should they appear.</p>

<p class="sig"><i>Dumfries, 1794,</i> or <i>1795.</i></p>

<p class="sig7"><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>

<p>I enclose you some copies of a couple of political ballads; one of
which, I believe, you have never seen. Would to Heaven I could make
you master of as many votes in the Stewartry&mdash;but&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</span>
<span class="i0">Does well, acts nobly, angels could no more.&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In order to bring my humble efforts to bear with more effect on the
foe, I have privately printed a good many copies of both ballads, and
have sent them among friends all about the country.</p>

<p>To pillory on Parnassus the rank reprobation of character, the utter
dereliction of all principle, in a profligate junto which has not only
outraged virtue, but violated common decency; which, spurning even
hypocrisy as paltry iniquity below their daring;&mdash;to unmask their
flagitiousness to the broadest day&mdash;to deliver such over to their
merited fate, is surely not merely innocent, but laudable; is not only
propriety, but virtue. You have already, as your auxiliary, the sober
detestation of mankind on the heads or your opponents; and I swear by
the lyre of Thalia to muster on your side all the votaries of honest
laughter, and fair, candid ridicule!</p>

<p>I am extremely obliged to you for your kind mention of my interests in
a letter which Mr. Syme showed me. At present my situation in life
must be in a great measure stationary, at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[494]</a></span> least for two or three
years. The statement is this&mdash;I am on the supervisors&#8217; list, and as we
come on there by precedency, in two or three years I shall be at the
head of that list, and be appointed <i>of course.</i> <i>Then</i>, a
<span class="smcap">friend</span> might be of service to me in getting me into a place
of the kingdom which I would like. A supervisor&#8217;s income varies from
about a hundred and twenty to two hundred a year; but the business is
an incessant drudgery, and would be nearly a complete bar to every
species of literary pursuit. The moment I am appointed supervisor, in
the common routine, I may be nominated on the collector&#8217;s list; and
this is always a business purely of political patronage. A
collector-ship varies much, from better than two hundred a year to
near a thousand. They also come forward by precedency on the list; and
have, besides a handsome income, a life of complete leisure. A life of
literary leisure with a decent competency, is the summit of my wishes.
It would be the prudish affectation of silly pride in me to say that I
do not need, or would not be indebted to a political friend; at the
same time, Sir, I by no means lay my affairs before you thus, to hook
my dependent situation on your benevolence. If, in my progress of
life, an opening should occur where the good offices of a gentleman of
your public character and political consequence might bring me
forward, I shall petition your goodness with the same frankness as I
now do myself the honour to subscribe myself</p>

<h3>TO MRS. DUNLOP,</h3>

<h4>IN LONDON.</h4>

<p>[In the correspondence of the poet with Mrs. Dunlop he rarely mentions
Thomson&#8217;s Collection of Songs, though his heart was set much upon it:
in the Dunlop library there are many letters from the poet, it is
said, which have not been published.]</p>

<p class="sig"><i>Dumfries, 20th December, 1795.</i></p>

<p>I have been prodigiously disappointed in this London journey of yours.
In the first place, when your last to me reached Dumfries, I was in
the country, and did not return until too late to answer your letter;
in the next place, I thought you would certainly take this route; and
now I know not what is become of you, or whether this may reach you at
all. God grant that it may find you and yours in prospering health and
good spirits! Do let me hear from you the soonest possible.</p>

<p>As I hope to get a frank from my friend Captain Miller, I shall every
leisure hour, take up the pen, and gossip away whatever comes first,
prose or poetry, sermon or song. In this last article I have abounded
of late. I have often mentioned to you a superb publication of
Scottish songs which is making its appearance in your great
metropolis, and where I have the honour to preside over the Scottish
verse, as no less a personage than Peter Pindar does over the English.</p>

<p class="sig"><i>December 29th.</i></p>

<p>Since I began this letter, I have been appointed to act in the
capacity of supervisor here, and I assure you, what with the load of
business, and what with that business being new to me, I could
scarcely have commanded ten minutes to have spoken to you, had you
been in town, much less to have written you an epistle. This
appointment is only temporary, and during the illness of the present
incumbent; but I look forward to an early period when I shall be
appointed in full form: a consummation devoutly to be wished! My
political sins seem to be forgiven me.</p>

<p>This is the season (New-year&#8217;s-day is now my date) of wishing; and
mine are most fervently offered up for you! May life to you be a
positive blessing while it lasts, for your own sake; and that it may
yet be greatly prolonged, is my wish for my own sake, and for the sake
of the rest of your friends! What a transient business is life! Very
lately I was a boy; but t&#8217;other day I was a young man; and I already
begin to feel the rigid fibre and stiffening joints of old age coming
fast o&#8217;er my frame. With all my follies of youth, and I fear, a few
vices of manhood, still I congratulate myself on having had in early
days religion strongly impressed on my mind. I have nothing to say to
any one as to which sect he belongs to, or what creed he believes: but
I look on the man, who is firmly persuaded of infinite wisdom and
goodness, superintending and directing every circumstance that can
happen in his lot&mdash;I felicitate such a man as having a solid
foundation for his mental enjoyment; a firm prop and sure stay, in the
hour of difficulty, trouble, and distress; and a never-failing anchor
of hope, when he looks beyond the grave.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">[495]</a></span></p>

<h4>ADDRESS OF THE SCOTCH DISTILLERS</h4>
<h3>TO THE RIGHT HON. WILLIAM PITT.</h3>

<p>[This ironical letter to the prime minister was found among the papers
of Burns.]</p>

<p class="sig7"><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>

<p>While pursy burgesses crowd your gate, sweating under the weight of
heavy addresses, permit us, the quondam distillers in that part of
Great Britain called Scotland, to approach you, not with venal
approbation, but with fraternal condolence; not as what you are just
now, or for some time have been; but as what, in all probability, you
will shortly be.&mdash;We shall have the merit of not deserting our friends
in the day of their calamity, and you will have the satisfaction of
perusing at least one honest address. You are well acquainted with the
dissection of human nature; nor do you need the assistance of a
fellow-creature&#8217;s bosom to inform you, that man is always a selfish,
often a perfidious being.&mdash;This assertion, however the hasty
conclusions of superficial observation may doubt of it, or the raw
inexperience of youth may deny it, those who make the fatal experiment
we have done, will feel.&mdash;You are a statesman, and consequently are
not ignorant of the traffic of these corporation compliments&mdash;The
little great man who drives the borough to market, and the very great
man who buys the borough in that market, they two do the whole
business; and you well know they, likewise, have their price. With
that sullen disdain which you can so well assume, rise, illustrious
Sir, and spurn these hireling efforts of venal stupidity. At best they
are the compliments of a man&#8217;s friends on the morning of his
execution: they take a decent farewell, resign you to your fate, and
hurry away from your approaching hour.</p>

<p>If fame say true, and omens be not very much mistaken, you are about
to make your exit from that world where the sun of gladness gilds the
paths of prosperous man: permit us, great Sir, with the sympathy of
fellow-feeling to hail your passage to the realms of ruin.</p>

<p>Whether the sentiment proceed from the selfishness or cowardice of
mankind is immaterial; but to point out to a child of misfortune those
who are still more unhappy, is to give him some degree of positive
enjoyment. In this light, Sir, our downfall may be again useful to
you:&mdash;though not exactly in the same way, it is not perhaps the first
time it has gratified your feelings. It is true, the triumph of your
evil star is exceedingly despiteful.&mdash;At an age when others are the
votaries of pleasure, or underlings in business, you had attained the
highest wish of a British statesman; and with the ordinary date of
human life, what a prospect was before you! Deeply rooted in <i>Royal
favour</i>, you overshadowed the land. The birds of passage, which follow
ministerial sunshine through every clime of political faith and
manners, flocked to your branches; and the beasts of the field (the
lordly possessors of hills and valleys) crowded under your shade. &#8220;But
behold a watcher, a holy one, came down from heaven, and cried aloud,
and said thus: Hew down the tree, and cut off his branches; shake off
his leaves, and scatter his fruit; let the beasts get away from under
it, and the fowls from his branches!&#8221; A blow from an unthought-of
quarter, one of those terrible accidents which peculiarly mark the
hand of Omnipotence, overset your career, and laid all your fancied
honours in the dust. But turn your eyes, Sir, to the tragic scenes of
our fate:&mdash;an ancient nation, that for many ages had gallantly
maintained the unequal struggle for independence with her much more
powerful neighbour, at last agrees to a union which should ever after
make them one people. In consideration of certain circumstances, it
was covenanted that the former should enjoy a stipulated alleviation
in her share of the public<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">[496]</a></span> burdens, particularly in that branch of
the revenue called the Excise. This just privilege has of late given
great umbrage to some interested, powerful individuals of the more
potent part of the empire, and they have spared no wicked pains, under
insidious pretexts, to subvert what they dared not openly to attack,
from the dread which they yet entertained of the spirit of their
ancient enemies.</p>

<p>In this conspiracy we fell; nor did we alone suffer, our country was
deeply wounded. A number of (we will say) respectable individuals,
largely engaged in trade, where we were not only useful, but
absolutely necessary to our country in her dearest interests; we, with
all that was near and dear to us, were sacrificed without remorse, to
the infernal deity of political expediency! We fell to gratify the
wishes of dark envy, and the views of unprincipled ambition! Your
foes, Sir, were avowed; were too brave to take an ungenerous
advantage; <i>you</i> fell in the face of day.&mdash;On the contrary, our
enemies, to complete our overthrow, contrived to make their guilt
appear the villany of a nation.&mdash;Your downfall only drags with you
your private friends and partisans: in our misery are more or less
involved the most numerous and most valuable part of the
community&mdash;all those who immediately depend on the cultivation of the
soil, from the landlord of a province, down to his lowest hind.</p>

<p>Allow us, Sir, yet further, just to hint at another rich vein of
comfort in the dreary regions of adversity;&mdash;the gratulations of an
approving conscience. In a certain great assembly, of which you are a
distinguished member, panegyrics on your private virtues have so often
wounded your delicacy, that we shall not distress you with anything on
the subject. There is, however, one part of your public conduct which
our feelings will not permit us to pass in silence: our gratitude must
trespass on your modesty; we mean, worthy Sir, your whole behaviour to
the Scots Distillers.&mdash;In evil hours, when obtrusive recollection
presses bitterly on the sense, let that, Sir, come like an healing
angel, and speak the peace to your soul which the world can neither
give nor take away.</p>

<p class="sig3">We have the honour to be,</p>

<p class="sig5">Sir,</p>

<p class="sig4">Your sympathizing fellow-sufferers,</p>

<p class="sig5">And grateful humble servants,</p>

were men of taste and feeling.]</p>

<p class="sig7"><span class="smcap">Gentlemen</span>,</p>

<p>The literary taste and liberal spirit of your good town has so ably
filled the various departments of your schools, as to make it a very
great object for a parent to have his children educated in them.
Still, to me, a stranger, with my large family, and very stinted
income, to give my young ones that education I wish, at the high fees
which a stranger pays, will bear hard upon me.</p>

<p>Some years ago your good town did me the honour of making me an
honorary burgess.&mdash;Will you allow me to request that this mark of
distinction may extend so far, as to put me on a footing of a real
freeman of the town, in the schools?</p>

<p>If you are so very kind as to grant my request, it will certainly be a
constant incentive to me to strain every nerve where I can officially
serve you; and will, if possible, increase that grateful respect with
which I have the honour to be,</p>

Revolution.]</p>

<p class="sig"><i>Dumfries, 20th January, 1796.</i></p>

<p>I cannot express my gratitude to you, for allowing me a longer perusal
of &#8220;Anacharsis.&#8221; In fact, I never met with a book that bewitched me so
much; and I, as a member of the library, must warmly feel the
obligation you have laid us under. Indeed to me the obligation is
stronger than to any other individual of our society; as &#8220;Anacharsis&#8221;
is an indispensable desideratum to a son of the muses.</p>

<p>The health you wished me in your morning&#8217;s card, is, I think, flown
from me for ever. I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">[497]</a></span> have not been able to leave my bed to-day till
about an hour ago. These wickedly unlucky advertisements I lent (I did
wrong) to a friend, and I am ill able to go in quest of him.</p>

<p>The muses have not quite forsaken me. The following detached stanza I
intend to interweave in some disastrous tale of a shepherd.</p>

charming communications.]</p>

<p class="sig"><i>Dumfries, 31st January, 1796.</i></p>

<p>These many months you have been two packets in my debt&mdash;what sin of
ignorance I have committed against so highly-valued a friend I am
utterly at a loss to guess. Alas! Madam, ill can I afford, at this
time, to be deprived of any of the small remnant of my pleasures. I
have lately drunk deep in the cup of affliction. The autumn robbed me
of my only daughter and darling child, and that at a distance too, and
so rapidly, as to put it out of my power to pay the last duties to
her. I had scarcely begun to recover from that shock, when I became
myself the victim of a most severe rheumatic fever, and long the die
spun doubtful; until, after many weeks of a sick bed, it seems to have
turned up life, and I am beginning to crawl across my room, and once
indeed have been before my own door in the street.</p>

<p>Many thanks, my dear Sir, for your handsome, elegant present to Mrs.
Burns, and for my remaining volume of P. Pindar. Peter is a delightful
fellow, and a first favourite of mine. I am much pleased with your
idea of publishing a collection of our songs in octavo, with etchings.
I am extremely willing to lend every assistance in my power. The Irish
airs I shall cheerfully undertake the task of finding verses for.</p>

<p>I have already, you know, equipt three with words, and the other day I
strung up a kind of rhapsody to another Hibernian melody, which I
admire much.</p>

<p>If this will do, you have now four of my Irish engagement. In my

fictitious name of a certain lady: but, on second thoughts, it is a
high incongruity to have a Greek appellation to a Scottish pastoral
ballad. Of this, and some things else, in my next: I have more
amendments to propose. What you once mentioned of &#8220;flaxen locks&#8221; is
just: they cannot enter into an elegant description of beauty. Of this

<p>Alas! my dear Thomson, I fear it will be some time ere I tune my lyre
again! &#8220;By Babel streams I have sat and wept&#8221; almost ever since I
wrote you last; I have only known existence by the pressure of the
heavy hand of sickness, and have counted time by the repercussions of
pain! Rheumatism, cold, and fever have formed to me a terrible
combination. I close my eyes in misery, and open them without hope. I
look on the vernal day, and say with poor Fergusson,</p>

admirable! The grouping is beyond all praise. The expression of the
figures, conformable to the story in the ballad, is absolutely
faultless perfection. I next admire &#8220;Turnim-spike.&#8221; What I like least
is &#8220;Jenny said to Jockey.&#8221; Besides the female being in her appearance
* * * *, if you take her stooping into the account, she is at least two
inches taller than her lover. Poor Cleghorn! I sincerely sympathize

health and enjoyment in this world. As for me&mdash;but that is a sad

<p>How are you, my dear friend, and how comes on your fifth volume? You
may probably think that for some time past I have neglected you and
your work; but, alas! the hand of pain, and sorrow, and care, has
these many months lain heavy on me! Personal and domestic affliction
have almost entirely banished that alacrity and life with which I used
to woo the rural muse of Scotia. In the meantime let us finish what we
have so well begun.</p>

<p>You are a good, worthy, honest fellow, and have a good right to live
in this world&mdash;because you deserve it. Many a merry meeting this
publication has given us, and possibly it may give us more, though,
alas! I fear it. This protracting, slow, consuming illness which hangs
over me, will, I doubt much, my ever dear friend, arrest my sun before
he has well reached his middle career, and will turn over the poet to
other and far more important concerns than studying the brilliancy of
wit, or the pathos of sentiment! However, <i>hope</i> is the cordial of the
human heart, and I endeavour to cherish it as well as I can.</p>

<p>Let me hear from you as soon as convenient.&mdash;Your work is a great one;
and now that it is finished, I see, if we were to begin again, two or
three things that might be mended; yet I will venture to prophesy,
that to future ages your publication will be the text-book and
standard of Scottish song and music.</p>

<p>I am ashamed to ask another favour of you, because you have been so
very good already; but my wife has a very particular friend of hers, a
young lady who sings well, to whom she wishes to present the &#8220;Scots
Musical Museum.&#8221; If you have a spare copy, will you be so obliging as
to send it by the very first <i>fly</i>, as I am anxious to have it soon.</p>

<p>The gentleman, Mr. Lewars, a particular friend of mine, will bring out
any proofs (if they are ready) or any message you may have. I am
extremely anxious for your work, as indeed I am for everything
concerning you, and your welfare.</p>

<p class="sig7"><span class="smcap">My dear Cunningham</span>,</p>

<p>I received yours here this moment, and am indeed highly flattered with
the approbation of the literary circle you mention; a literary circle
inferior to none in the two kingdoms. Alas! my friend, I fear the
voice of the bard will soon be heard among you no more! For these
eight or ten months I have been ailing, sometimes bedfast and
sometimes not; but these last three months I have been tortured with
an excruciating rheumatism, which has reduced me to nearly the last
stage. You actually would not know me if you saw me&mdash;Pale, emaciated,
and so feeble, as occasionally to need help from my chair&mdash;my spirits
fled! fled! but I can no more on the subject&mdash;only the medical folks
tell me that my last only chance is bathing and country-quarters, and
riding.&mdash;The deuce of the matter is this; when an exciseman is off
duty, his salary is reduced to 35<i>l.</i> instead of 50<i>l.</i>&mdash;What way, in
the name of thrift, shall I maintain myself, and keep a horse in
country quarters&mdash;with a wife and five children at home, on 35<i>l.</i>? I
mention this, because I had intended to beg your utmost interest, and
that of all the friends you can muster, to move our commissioners of
excise to grant me the full salary; I dare say you know them all
personally. If they do not grant it me, I must lay my account with an
exit truly <i>en po&euml;te</i>&mdash;if I die not of disease, I must perish with
hunger.</p>

<p>I have sent you one of the songs; the other my memory does not serve
me with, and I have no copy here; but I shall be at home soon, when I
will send it you.&mdash;Apropos to being at home, Mrs. Burns threatens, in
a week or two, to add one more to my paternal charge, which, if of the
right gender, I intend shall be introduced to the world by the
respectable designation of <i>Alexander Cunningham Burns.</i> My last was
<i>James Glencairn</i>, so you can have no objection to the company of
nobility. Farewell.</p>

<p>[This letter contained heavy news for Gilbert Burns: the loss of a

<p class="sig7"><span class="smcap">Dear Brother</span>,</p>

<p>It will be no very pleasing news to you to be told that I am
dangerously ill, and not likely to get better. An inveterate
rheumatism has reduced me to such a state of debility, and my appetite
is so totally gone, that I can scarcely stand on my legs. I have been
a week at sea-bathing, and I will continue there, or in a friend&#8217;s
house in the country, all the summer. God keep my wife and children:
if I am taken from their head, they will be poor indeed. I have
contracted one or two serious debts, partly from my illness these many
months, partly from too much thoughtlessness as to expense, when I
came to town, that will cut in too much on the little I leave them in
your hands. Remember me to my mother.</p>

<p>For Heaven&#8217;s sake, and as you value the we[l]fare of your daughter and
my wife, do, my dearest Sir, write to Fife, to Mrs. Armour to come if
possible. My wife thinks she can yet reckon upon a fortnight. The
medical people order me, <i>as I value my existence</i>, to fly to
sea-bathing and country-quarters, so it is ten thousand chances to one
that I shall not be within a dozen miles of her when her hour comes.
What a situation for her, poor girl, without a single friend by her on
such a serious moment.</p>

<p>I have now been a week at salt-water, and though I think I have got
some good by it, yet I have some secret fears that this business will
be dangerous if not fatal.</p>

<h3>TO MRS. BURNS.</h3>

<p>[Sea-bathing, I have heard skilful men say, was injudicious: but it
was felt that Burns was on his way to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">[501]</a></span> grave, and as he desired to
try the influence of sea-water, as well as sea-air, his wishes were

<p>I delayed writing until I could tell you what effect sea-bathing was
likely to produce. It would be injustice to deny that it has eased my
pains, and I think has strengthened me; but my appetite is still
extremely bad. No flesh nor fish can I swallow: porridge and milk are
the only things I can taste. I am very happy to hear, by Miss Jess
Lewars, that you are all well. My very best and kindest compliments to
her, and to all the children. I will see you on Sunday.</p>

<p>I have written you so often, without receiving any answer, that I
would not trouble you again, but for the circumstances in which I am.
An illness which has long hung about me, in all probability will
speedily send me beyond that <i>bourn whence no traveller returns.</i> Your
friendship, with which for many years you honoured me, was a
friendship dearest to my soul. Your conversation, and especially your

<p>[Thomson instantly complied with the dying poet&#8217;s request, and
transmitted the exact sum which he requested, viz. five pounds, by
return of post: he was afraid of offending the pride of Burns,
otherwise he would, he says, have sent a larger sum. He has not,
however, told us how much he sent to the all but desolate widow and

I owe an account, taking it into his head that I am dying, has
commenced a process, and will infallibly put me into jail. Do, for
God&#8217;s sake, send me that sum, and that by return of post. Forgive me
this earnestness, but the horrors of a jail have made me half
distracted. I do not ask all this gratuitously; for, upon returning
health, I hereby promise and engage to furnish you with five pounds&#8217;
worth of the neatest song-genius you have seen. I tried my hand on
&#8220;Rothemurche&#8221; this morning. The measure is so difficult that it is
impossible to infuse much genius into the lines; they are on the other
side. Forgive, forgive me!</p>

<p class="sig"><i>Brow, 12th July.</i></p>

<p class="sig7"><span class="smcap">My dear Cousin</span>,</p>

<p>When you offered me money assistance, little did I think I should want
it so soon. A rascal of a haberdasher, to whom I owe a considerable
bill, taking it into his head that I am dying, has commenced process
against me, and will infallibly put my emaciated body into jail. Will
you be so good as to accommodate me, and that by return of post, with
ten pounds? O James! did you know the pride of my heart, you would
feel doubly for me! Alas! I am not used to beg! The worst of it is, my
health was coming about finely; you know, and my physician assured me,
that melancholy and low spirits are half my disease; guess then my
horrors since this business began. If I had it settled, I would be, I
think, quite well in a manner. How shall I use the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">[502]</a></span> language to you, O
do not disappoint me! but strong necessity&#8217;s curst command.</p>

<p>I have been thinking over and over my brother&#8217;s affairs, and I fear I
must cut him up; but on this I will correspond at another time,
particularly as I shall [require] your advice.</p>

<p>Forgive me for once more mentioning by return of post;&mdash;save me from
the horrors of a jail!</p>

<p>My compliments to my friend James, and to all the rest. I do not know

<h3><a name="REMARKS" id="REMARKS"></a>REMARKS</h3>
<h5>ON</h5>
<h2>SCOTTISH SONGS AND BALLADS.</h2>
<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<p>[The following Strictures on Scottish Song exist in the handwriting of
Burns, in the interleaved copy of Johnson&#8217;s Musical Museum, which the
poet presented to Captain Riddel, of Friars Carse; on the death of
Mrs. Riddel, these precious volumes passed into the hands of her
niece, Eliza Bayley, of Manchester, who kindly permitted Mr. Cromek to
transcribe and publish them in the Reliques.]</p>
<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<h3>THE HIGHLAND QUEEN.</h3>

<p>This Highland Queen, music and poetry, was composed by Mr. M&#8217;Vicar,
purser of the Solebay man-of-war.&mdash;This I had from Dr. Blacklock.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />


<h3>BESS THE GAWKIE.</h3>

<p>This song shows that the Scottish muses did not all leave us when we
lost Ramsay and Oswald, as I have good reason to believe that the
verses and music are both posterior to the days of these two
gentlemen. It is a beautiful song, and in the genuine Scots taste. We
have few pastoral compositions, I mean the pastoral of nature, that
are equal to this.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />


<h3>OH, OPEN THE DOOR, LORD GREGORY.</h3>

<p>It is somewhat singular, that in Lanark, Renfrew, Ayr, Wigton,
Kirkudbright, and Dumfries-shires, there is scarcely an old song or
tune which, from the title, &amp;c., can be guessed to belong to, or be
the production of these countries. This, I conjecture, is one of these
very few; as the ballad, which is a long one, is called, both by
tradition and in printed collections, &#8220;The Lass of Lochroyan,&#8221; which I
take to be Lochroyan, in Galloway.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />


<h3>THE BANKS OF THE TWEED.</h3>

<p>This song is one of the many attempts that English composers have made
to imitate the Scottish manner, and which I shall, in these
strictures, beg leave to distinguish by the ap<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">[503]</a></span>pellation of
Anglo-Scottish productions. The music is pretty good, but the verses
are just above contempt.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />


<h3>THE BEDS OF SWEET ROSES.</h3>

<p>This song, as far as I know, for the first time appears here in
print.&mdash;When I was a boy, it was a very popular song in Ayrshire. I
remember to have heard those fanatics, the Buchanites, sing some of
their nonsensical rhymes, which they dignify with the name of hymns,
to this air.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />


<h3>ROSLIN CASTLE.</h3>

<p>These beautiful verses were the production of a Richard Hewit, a young
man that Dr. Blacklock, to whom I am indebted for the anecdote, kept
for some years as amanuensis. I do not know who is the author of
the second song to the tune. Tytler, in his amusing history of Scots
music, gives the air to Oswald; but in Oswald&#8217;s own collection of
Scots tunes, where he affixes an asterisk to those he himself
composed, he does not make the least claim to the tune.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />


<h3>SAW YE JOHNNIE CUMMIN? QUO&#8217; SHE.</h3>

<p>This song, for genuine humour in the verses, and lively originality in
the air, is unparalleled. I take it to be very old.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />


<h3>CLOUT THE CALDRON.</h3>

<p>A tradition is mentioned in the &#8220;Bee,&#8221; that the second Bishop
Chisholm, of Dunblane, used to say, that if he were going to be
hanged, nothing would soothe his mind so much by the way as to hear
&#8220;Clout the Caldron&#8221; played.</p>

<p>I have met with another tradition, that the old song to this tune,</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;Hae ye onie pots or pans,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or onie broken chanlers,&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>was composed on one of the Kenmure family, in the cavalier times; and
alluded to an amour he had, while under hiding, in the disguise of an
itinerant tinker. The air is also known by the name of</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;The blacksmith and his apron,&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>which from the rhythm, seems to have been a line of some old song to
the tune.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />


<h3>SAW YE MY PEGGY.</h3>

<p>This charming song is much older, and indeed superior to Ramsay&#8217;s
verses, &#8220;The Toast,&#8221; as he calls them. There is another set of the
words, much older still, and which I take to be the original one, but
though it has a very great deal of merit, it is not quite ladies&#8217;
reading.</p>

<p>The original words, for they can scarcely be called verses, seem to be
as follows; a song familiar from the cradle to every Scottish ear.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;Saw ye my Maggie,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Saw ye my Maggie,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Saw ye my Maggie<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Linkin o&#8217;er the lea?<br />
</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">High kilted was she,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">High kilted was she,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">High kilted was she,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Her coat aboon her knee.<br />
</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">What mark has your Maggie,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What mark has your Maggie,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What mark has your Maggie,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">That ane may ken her be?&#8221;<br />
</span>
</div></div>

<p>Though it by no means follows that the silliest verses to an air must,
for that reason, be the original song; yet I take this ballad, of
which I have quoted part, to be old verses. The two songs in Ramsay,
one of them evidently his own, are never to be met with in the
fire-side circle of our peasantry; while that which I take to be the
old song, is in every shepherd&#8217;s mouth. Ramsay, I suppose, had thought
the old verses unworthy of a place in his collection.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />


<h3>THE FLOWERS OF EDINBURGH.</h3>

<p>This song is one of the many effusions of Scots Jacobitism.&mdash;The title
&#8220;Flowers of Edinburgh,&#8221; has no manner of connexion with the present
verses, so I suspect there has been an older set of words, of which
the title is all that remains.</p>

<p>By the bye, it is singular enough that the Scottish muses were all
Jacobites.&mdash;I have paid more attention to every description of Scots
songs than perhaps anybody living has done, and I do not recollect one
single stanza, or even the title of the most trifling Scots air, which
has the least panegyrical reference to the families of Nassau or
Brunswick; while there are hundreds satirizing them.&mdash;This may be
thought no panegyric on the Scots Poets, but I mean it as such. For
myself, I would always take it as a compliment to have it said, that
my heart ran before my head,&mdash;and surely the gallant though<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">[504]</a></span>
unfortunate house of Stewart, the kings of our fathers for so many
heroic ages, is a theme  *  *  *  *  *  *</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />


<h3>JAMIE GAY.</h3>

<p>Jamie Gay is another and a tolerable Anglo-Scottish piece.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />


<h3>MY DEAR JOCKIE.</h3>

<p>Another Anglo-Scottish production.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />


<h3>FYE, GAE RUB HER O&#8217;ER WI&#8217; STRAE.</h3>

<p>It is self-evident that the first four lines of this song are part of
a song more ancient than Ramsay&#8217;s beautiful verses which are annexed
to them. As music is the language of nature; and poetry, particularly
songs, are always less or more localized (if I may be allowed the
verb) by some of the modifications of time and place, this is the
reason why so many of our Scots airs have outlived their original, and
perhaps many subsequent sets of verses; except a single name or
phrase, or sometimes one or two lines, simply to distinguish the tunes
by.</p>

<p>To this day among people who know nothing of Ramsay&#8217;s verses, the
following is the song, and all the song that ever I heard:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;Gin ye meet a bonnie lassie,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Gie her a kiss and let her gae;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But gin ye meet a dirty hizzie,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Fye, gae rub her o&#8217;er wi&#8217; strae.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Fye, gae rub her, rub her, rub her,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Fye, gae rub her o&#8217;er wi&#8217; strae:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An&#8217; gin ye meet dirty hizzie,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Fye, gae rub her o&#8217;er wi&#8217; strae.&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />


<h3>THE LASS O&#8217; LIVISTON.</h3>

<p>The old song, in three eight-line stanzas, is well known, and has
merit as to wit and humour; but it is rather unfit for insertion.&mdash;It
begins,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;The Bonnie lass o&#8217; Liviston,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Her name ye ken, her name ye ken,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And she has written in her contract<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To lie her lane, to lie her lane.&#8221;<br /></span>
<span class="i6">&amp;c. &amp;c.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />


<h3>THE LAST TIME I CAME O&#8217;ER THE MOOR.</h3>

<p>Ramsay found the first line of this song, which had been preserved as
the title of the charming air, and then composed the rest of the
verses to suit that line. This has always a finer effect than
composing English words, or words with an idea foreign to the spirit
of the old title. Where old titles of songs convey any idea at all, it
will generally be found to be quite in the spirit of the air.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />


<h3>JOCKIE&#8217;S GRAY BREEKS.</h3>

<p>Though this has certainly every evidence of being a Scottish air, yet
there is a well-known tune and song in the north of Ireland, called
&#8220;The Weaver and his Shuttle O,&#8221; which, though sung much quicker, is
every note the very tune.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />


<h3>THE HAPPY MARRIAGE.</h3>

<p>Another, but very pretty Anglo-Scottish piece.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />


<h3>THE LASS OF PATIE&#8217;S MILL.</h3>

<p>In Sinclair&#8217;s Statistical Account of Scotland, this song is localized
(a verb I must use for want of another to express my idea) somewhere
in the north of Scotland, and likewise is claimed by Ayrshire.&mdash;The
following anecdote I had from the present Sir William Cunningham, of
Robertland, who had it from the last John, Earl of Loudon. The then
Earl of Loudon, and father to Earl John before mentioned, had Ramsay
at Loudon, and one day walking together by the banks of Irvine water,
near New-Mills, at a place called Patie&#8217;s Mill, they were struck with
the appearance of a beautiful country girl. His lordship observed that
she would be a fine theme for a song.&mdash;Allan lagged behind in
returning to Loudon Castle, and at dinner produced this identical
song.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />


<h3>THE TURNIMSPIKE.</h3>

<p>There is a stanza of this excellent song for local humour, omitted in
this set.&mdash;Where I have placed the asterisms.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;They tak the horse then by te head,<br /></span>

<h3>HIGHLAND LADDIE.</h3>

<p>As this was a favourite theme with our later Scottish muses, there are
several airs and songs<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">[505]</a></span> of that name. That which I take to be the
oldest, is to be found in the &#8220;Musical Museum,&#8221; beginning, &#8220;I hae been
at Crookieden.&#8221; One reason for my thinking so is, that Oswald has it
in his collection, by the name of &#8220;The Auld Highland Laddie.&#8221; It is
also known by the name of &#8220;Jinglan Johnie,&#8221; which is a well-known song
of four or five stanzas, and seems to be an earlier song than Jacobite
times. As a proof of this, it is little known to the peasantry by the
name of &#8220;Highland Laddie;&#8221; while everybody knows &#8220;Jinglan Johnie.&#8221; The
song begins</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;Jinglan John, the meickle man,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He met wi&#8217; a lass was blythe and bonie.&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Another &#8220;Highland Laddie&#8221; is also in the &#8220;Museum,&#8221; vol. v., which I
take to be Ramsay&#8217;s original, as he has borrowed the chorus&mdash;&#8220;O my
bonie Highland lad,&#8221; &amp;c. It consists of three stanzas, besides the
chorus; and has humour in its composition&mdash;it is an excellent, but
somewhat licentious song.&mdash;It begins</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;As I cam o&#8217;er Cairney mount,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And down among the blooming heather.&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This air, and the common &#8220;Highland Laddie,&#8221; seem only to be different
sets.</p>

<p>Another &#8220;Highland Laddie,&#8221; also in the &#8220;Museum,&#8221; vol. v., is the tune
of several Jacobite fragments. One of these old songs to it, only
exists, as far as I know, in these four lines&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;Where hae ye been a&#8217; day,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Bonie laddie, Highland laddie?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Down the back o&#8217; Bell&#8217;s brae,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Courtin Maggie, courtin Maggie.&#8221;<br /></span>

&#8220;Highland Laddie.&#8221;</p>

<h3>THE GENTLE SWAIN.</h3>

<p>To sing such a beautiful air to such execrable verses, is downright
prostitution of common sense! The Scots verses indeed are tolerable.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />


<h3>HE STOLE MY TENDER HEART AWAY.</h3>

<p>This is an Anglo-Scottish production, but by no means a bad one.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />


<h3>FAIREST OF THE FAIR.</h3>

<p>It is too barefaced to take Dr. Percy&#8217;s charming song, and by means of
transposing a few English words into Scots, to offer to pass it for a
Scots song.&mdash;I was not acquainted with the editor until the first
volume was nearly finished, else, had I known in time, I would have
prevented such an impudent absurdity.</p>

<h3>THE BLAITHRIE O&#8217;T.</h3>

<p>The following is a set of this song, which was the earliest song I
remember to have got by heart. When a child, an old woman sung it to
me, and I picked it up, every word, at first hearing.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<h3>MAY EVE, OR KATE OF ABERDEEN.</h3>

<p>&#8220;Kate of Aberdeen&#8221; is, I believe, the work of poor Cunningham the
player; of whom the following anecdote, though told before, deserves a
recital. A fat dignitary of the church coming past Cunningham one
<i>Sunday</i>, as the poor poet was busy plying a fishing-rod in some
stream near Durham, his native country, his reverence reprimanded
Cunningham very se<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">[506]</a></span>verely for such an occupation on such a day. The
poor poet, with that inoffensive gentleness of manners which was his
peculiar characteristic, replied, that he hoped God and his reverence
would forgive his seeming profanity of that sacred day, &#8220;<i>as he had no
dinner to eat, but what lay at the bottom of that pool</i>!&#8221; This, Mr.
Woods, the player, who knew Cunningham well, and esteemed him much,
assured me was true.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />


<h3>TWEED SIDE.</h3>

<p>In Ramsay&#8217;s Tea-table Miscellany, he tells us that about thirty of the
songs in that publication were the works of some young gentlemen of
his acquaintance; which songs are marked with the letters D. C.
&amp;c.&mdash;Old Mr. Tytler of Woodhouselee, the worthy and able defender of
the beauteous Queen of Scots, told me that the songs marked C, in the
<i>Tea-table</i>, were the composition of a Mr. Crawfurd, of the house of
Achnames, who was afterwards unfortunately drowned coming from
France.&mdash;As Tytler was most intimately acquainted with Allan Ramsay, I
think the anecdote may be depended on. Of consequence, the beautiful
song of Tweed Side is Mr. Crawfurd&#8217;s, and indeed does great honour to
his poetical talents. He was a Robert Crawfurd; the Mary he celebrates
was a Mary Stewart, of the Castle-Milk family, afterwards married to a
Mr. John Ritchie.</p>

<p>I have seen a song, calling itself the original Tweed Side, and said
to have been composed by a Lord Yester. It consisted of two stanzas,
of which I still recollect the first&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;When Maggy and I was acquaint,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I carried my noddle fu&#8217; hie;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nae lintwhite on a&#8217; the green plain,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Nor gowdspink sae happy as me:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But I saw her sae fair and I lo&#8217;ed:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I woo&#8217;d, but I came nae great speed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So now I maun wander abroad,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And lay my banes far frae the Tweed.&#8221;&mdash;<br /></span>

<h3>THE POSY.</h3>

<p>It appears evident to me that Oswald composed his <i>Roslin Castle</i> on
the modulation of this air.&mdash;In the second part of Oswald&#8217;s, in the
three first bars, he has either hit on a wonderful similarity to, or
else he has entirely borrowed the three first bars of the old air; and
the close of both tunes is almost exactly the same. The old verses to
which it was sung, when I took down the notes from a country girl&#8217;s
voice, had no great merit.&mdash;The following is a specimen:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;There was a pretty May, and a milkin she went;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Wi&#8217; her red rosy cheeks, and her coal black hair;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And she has met a young man a comin o&#8217;er the bent,<br /></span>

<h3>MARY&#8217;S DREAM.</h3>

<p>The Mary here alluded to is generally supposed to be Miss Mary
Macghie, daughter to the Laird of Airds, in Galloway. The poet was a
Mr. John Lowe, who likewise wrote another beautiful song, called
Pompey&#8217;s Ghost.&mdash;I have seen a poetic epistle from him in North
America, where he now is, or lately was, to a lady in Scotland.&mdash;By
the strain of the verses, it appeared that they allude to some love
affair.</p>

<h3>I WISH MY LOVE WERE IN A MIRE.</h3>

<p>I never heard more of the words of this old song than the title.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />


<h3>ALLAN WATER.</h3>

<p>This Allan Water, which the composer of the music has honoured with
the name of the air, I have been told is Allan Water, in Strathallan.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />


<h3>THERE&#8217;S NAE LUCK ABOUT THE HOUSE.</h3>

<p>This is one of the most beautiful songs in the Scots, or any other

<span class="i0">&#8220;And will I see his face again!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And will I hear him speak!&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>as well as the two preceding ones, are unequalled almost by anything I
ever heard or read: and the lines,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">[507]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;The present moment is our ain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The neist we never saw,&#8221;&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>are worthy of the first poet. It is long posterior to Ramsay&#8217;s days.
About the year 1771, or 72, it came first on the streets as a ballad;
and I suppose the composition of the song was not much anterior to
that period.</p>

<h3>TARRY WOO.</h3>

<p>This is a very pretty song; but I fancy that the first half stanza, as

<h3>GRAMACHREE.</h3>

<p>The song of Gramachree was composed by a Mr. Poe, a counsellor at law
in Dublin. This anecdote I had from a gentleman who knew the lady, the
&#8220;Molly,&#8221; who is the subject of the song, and to whom Mr. Poe sent the
first manuscript of his most beautiful verses. I do not remember any
single line that has more true pathos than</p>

<span class="i0">&#8220;How can she break that honest heart that wears her in its core!&#8221;<br /></span>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />


<h3>THE COLLIER&#8217;S BONNIE LASSIE.</h3>

<p>The first half stanza is much older than the days of Ramsay.&mdash;The old
words began thus:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;The collier has a dochter, and, O, she&#8217;s wonder bonnie!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A laird he was that sought her, rich baith in lands and money.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She wad na hae a laird, nor wad she be a lady,<br /></span>

<h3>MY AIN KIND DEARIE-O.</h3>

<p>The old words of this song are omitted here, though much more
beautiful than these inserted; which were mostly composed by poor
Fergusson, in one of his merry humours. The old words began thus:</p>

<h3>MARY SCOTT, THE FLOWER OF YARROW.</h3>

<p>Mr. Robertson, in his statistical account of the parish of Selkirk,
says, that Mary Scott, the Flower of Yarrow, was descended from the
Dryhope, and married into the Harden family. Her daughter was married
to a predecessor of the present Sir Francis Elliot, of Stobbs, and of
the late Lord Heathfield.</p>

<p>There is a circumstance in their contract of marriage that merits
attention, and it strongly marks the predatory spirit of the times.
The father-in-law agrees to keep his daughter for some time after the
marriage; for which the son-in-law binds himself to give him the
profits of the first Michaelmas moon!</p>

<h3>DOWN THE BURN, DAVIE.</h3>

<p>I have been informed, that the tune of &#8220;Down the burn, Davie,&#8221; was the
composition of David Maigh, keeper of the blood slough hounds,
belonging to the Laird of Riddel, in Tweeddale.</p>

<p>I find the &#8220;Blithsome Bridal&#8221; in James Watson&#8217;s collection of Scots

<h3>THE BONIE BRUCKET LASSIE.</h3>

<p>The two first lines of this song are all of it that is old. The rest
of the song, as well as those songs in the Museum marked T., are the
works of an obscure, tippling, but extraordinary body of the name of
Tytler, commonly known by the name of Balloon Tytler, from his having
projected a balloon; a mortal, who, though he drudges about Edinburgh
as a common printer, with leaky shoes, a sky-lighted hat, and
knee-buckles as unlike as George-by-the-grace-of-God, and
Solomon-the-son-of-David; yet that same unknown drunken mortal is
author and compiler of three-fourths of Elliot&#8217;s pompous Encyclopedia

which, when I saw it, in the year 1787, was composed of eight or nine
ragged birches. The Earl of Traquair has planted a clump of trees near
by, which he calls &#8220;The New Bush.&#8221;</p>

<h3>CROMLET&#8217;S LILT.</h3>

<p>The following interesting account of this plaintive dirge was
communicated to Mr. Riddel by Alexander Fraser Tytler, Esq., of
Woodhouselee.</p>

<p>&#8220;In the latter end of the sixteenth century, the Chisolms were
proprietors of the estate of Cromlecks (now possessed by the
Drummonds). The eldest son of that family was very much attached to a
daughter of Sterling of Ardoch, commonly known by the name of Fair
Helen of Ardoch.</p>

<p>&#8220;At that time the opportunities of meeting betwixt the sexes were more
rare, consequently more sought after than now; and the Scottish
ladies, far from priding themselves on extensive literature, were
thought sufficiently book-learned if they could make out the
Scriptures in their mother-tongue. Writing was entirely out of the
line of female education. At that period the most of our young men of
family sought a fortune, or found a grave, in France. Cromlus, when he
went abroad to the war, was obliged to leave the management of his
correspondence with his mistress to a lay-brother of the monastery of
Dumblain, in the immediate neighbourhood of Cromleck, and near Ardoch.
This man, unfortunately, was deeply sensible of Helen&#8217;s charms. He
artfully prepossessed her with stories to the disadvantage of Cromlus;
and, by misinterpreting or keeping up the letters and messages
intrusted to his care, he entirely irritated both. All connexion was
broken off betwixt them; Helen was inconsolable, and Cromlus has left
behind him, in the ballad called &#8216;Cromlet&#8217;s Lilt,&#8217; a proof of the
elegance of his genius, as well as the steadiness of his love.</p>

<p>&#8220;When the artful monk thought time had sufficiently softened Helen&#8217;s
sorrow, he proposed himself as a lover: Helen was obdurate: but at
last, overcome by the persuasions of her brother, with whom she lived,
and who, having a family of thirty-one children, was probably very
well pleased to get her off his hands&mdash;she submitted, rather than
consented to the ceremony; but there her compliance ended; and, when
forcibly put into bed, she started quite frantic from it, screaming
out, that after three gentle taps on the wainscot, at the bed-head,
she heard Cromlus&#8217;s voice, crying, &#8216;Helen, Helen, mind me!&#8217; Cromlus
soon after coming home, the treachery of the confidant was
dis<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509">[509]</a></span>covered,&mdash;her marriage disannulled,&mdash;and Helen became Lady
Cromlecks.&#8221;</p>

<p>N. B. Marg. Murray, mother to these thirty-one children, was daughter
to Murray of Strewn, one of the seventeen sons of Tullybardine, and
whose youngest son, commonly called the Tutor of Ardoch, died in the
year 1715, aged 111 years.</p>

<h3>MY DEARIE, IF THOU DIE.</h3>

<p>Another beautiful song of Crawfurd&#8217;s.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />


<h3>SHE ROSE AND LOOT ME IN.</h3>

<p>The old set of this song, which is still to be found in printed
collections, is much prettier than this; but somebody, I believe it
was Ramsay, took it into his head to clear it of some seeming
indelicacies, and made it at once more chaste and more dull.</p>

<h3>GO TO THE EWE-BUGHTS, MARION.</h3>

<p>I am not sure if this old and charming air be of the South, as is
commonly said, or of the North of Scotland. There is a song,
apparently as ancient us &#8220;Ewe-bughts, Marion,&#8221; which sings to the same
tune, and is evidently of the North.&mdash;It begins thus:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<h3>LEWIS GORDON.</h3>

<p>This air is a proof how one of our Scots tunes comes to be composed
out of another. I have one of the earliest copies of the song, and it
has prefixed,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;Tune of Tarry Woo.&#8221;&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Of which tune a different set has insensibly varied into a different
air.&mdash;To a Scots critic, the pathos of the line,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;&#8216;Tho&#8217; his back be at the wa&#8217;,&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>&mdash;must be very striking. It needs not a Jacobite prejudice to be
affected with this song.</p>

<p>The supposed author of &#8220;Lewis Gordon&#8221; was a Mr. Geddes, priest, at
Shenval, in the Ainzie.</p>

<h3>O HONE A RIE.</h3>

<p>Dr. Blacklock informed me that this song was composed on the infamous
massacre of Glencoe.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />


<h3>I&#8217;LL NEVER LEAVE THEE.</h3>

<p>This is another of Crawfurd&#8217;s songs, but I do not think in his
happiest manner.&mdash;What an absurdity, to join such names as <i>Adonis</i>
and <i>Mary</i> together!</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />


<h3>CORN RIGS ARE BONIE.</h3>

<p>All the old words that ever I could meet to this air were the
following, which seem to have been an old chorus:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;O corn rigs and rye rigs,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">O corn rigs are bonie;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And where&#8217;er you meet a bonie lass,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Preen up her cockernony.&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />


<h3>THE MUCKING OF GEORDIE&#8217;S BYRE.</h3>

<p>The chorus of this song is old; the rest is the work of Balloon
Tytler.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />


<h3>BIDE YE YET.</h3>

<p>There is a beautiful song to this tune, beginning,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;Alas, my son, you little know,&#8221;&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>which is the composition of Miss Jenny Graham, of Dumfries.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />


<h3>WAUKIN O&#8217; THE FAULD.</h3>

<p>There are two stanzas still sung to this tune, which I take to be the
original song whence Ramsay composed his beautiful song of that name
in the Gentle Shepherd.&mdash;It begins</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;O will ye speak at our town,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As ye come frae the fauld.&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>I regret that, as in many of our old songs, the delicacy of this old
fragment is not equal to its wit and humour.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />


<h3>TRANENT-MUIR.</h3>

<p>&#8220;Tranent-Muir,&#8221; was composed by a Mr. Skirving, a very worthy
respectable farmer near Haddington. I have heard the anecdote often,
that Lieut. Smith, whom he mentions in the ninth stanza, came to
Haddington after the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_510" id="Page_510">[510]</a></span> publication of the song, and sent a challenge to
Skirving to meet him at Haddington, and answer for the unworthy manner
in which he had noticed him in his song. &#8220;Gang away back,&#8221; said the
honest farmer, &#8220;and tell Mr. Smith that I hae nae leisure to come to
Haddington; but tell him to come here, and I&#8217;ll tak a look o&#8217; him, and
if I think I&#8217;m fit to fecht him, I&#8217;ll fecht him; and if no, I&#8217;ll do as
he did&mdash;<i>I&#8217;ll rin awa.&#8221;</i>&mdash;</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />


<h3>TO THE WEAVERS GIN YE GO.</h3>

<p>The chorus of this song is old, the rest of it is mine. Here, once for
all, let me apologize for many silly compositions of mine in this
work. Many beautiful airs wanted words; in the hurry of other
avocations, if I could string a parcel of rhymes together anything
near tolerable, I was fain to let them pass. He must be an excellent
poet indeed whose every performance is excellent.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />


<h3>POLWARTH ON THE GREEN.</h3>

<p>The author of &#8220;Polwarth on the Green&#8221; is Capt. John Drummond M&#8217;Gregor,
of the family of Bochaldie.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />


<h3>STREPHON AND LYDIA.</h3>

<p>The following account of this song I had from Dr. Blacklock.</p>

<p>The Strephon and Lydia mentioned in the song were perhaps the
loveliest couple of their time. The gentleman was commonly known by
the name of Beau Gibson. The lady was the &#8220;Gentle Jean,&#8221; celebrated
somewhere in Hamilton of Bangour&#8217;s poems.&mdash;Having frequently met at
public places, they had formed a reciprocal attachment, which their
friends thought dangerous, as their resources were by no means
adequate to their tastes and habits of life. To elude the bad
consequences of such a connexion, Strephon was sent abroad with a
commission, and perished in Admiral Vernon&#8217;s expedition to Carthagena.</p>

<p>The author of this song was William Wallace, Esq. of Cairnhill, in
Ayrshire.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />


<h3>I&#8217;M O&#8217;ER YOUNG TO MARRY YET.</h3>

<p>The chorus of this song is old. The rest of it, such as it is, is
mine.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />


<h3>M&#8217;PHERSON&#8217;S FAREWELL.</h3>

<p>M&#8217;Pherson, a daring robber, in the beginning of this century, was
condemned to be hanged at the assizes of Inverness. He is said, when
under sentence of death, to have composed this tune, which he called
his own lament or farewell.</p>

<p>Gow has published a variation of this fine tune as his own
composition, which he calls &#8220;The Princess Augusta.&#8221;</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />


<h3>MY JO, JANET.</h3>

<p>Johnson, the publisher, with a foolish delicacy, refused to insert the
last stanza of this humorous ballad.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />


<h3>THE SHEPHERD&#8217;S COMPLAINT.</h3>

<p>The words by a Mr. R. Scott, from the town or neighbourhood of Biggar.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />


<h3>THE BIRKS OF ABERFELDY.</h3>

<p>I composed these stanzas standing under the falls of Aberfeldy, at or
near Moness.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />


<h3>THE HIGHLAND LASSIE O.</h3>

<p>This was a composition of mine in very early life, before I was known
at all in the world. My Highland lassie was a warm-hearted, charming
young creature as ever blessed a man with generous love. After a
pretty long tract of the most ardent reciprocal attachment, we met by
appointment on the second Sunday of May, in a sequestered spot by the
banks of Ayr, where we spent the day in taking a farewell before she
should embark for the West Highlands, to arrange matters among her
friends for our projected change of life. At the close of autumn
following she crossed the sea to meet me at Greenock, where she had
scarce landed when she was seized with a malignant fever, which
hurried my dear girl to the grave in a few days, before I could even
hear of her last illness.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />


<h3>FIFE, AND A&#8217; THE LANDS ABOUT IT.</h3>

<p>This song is Dr. Blacklock&#8217;s. He, as well as I, often gave Johnson
verses, trifling enough<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_511" id="Page_511">[511]</a></span> perhaps, but they served as a vehicle to the
music.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />


<h3>WERE NA MY HEART LIGHT I WAD DIE.</h3>

<p>Lord Hailes, in the notes to his collection of ancient Scots poems,
says that this song was the composition of a Lady Grissel Baillie,
daughter of the first Earl of Marchmont, and wife of George Baillie,
of Jerviswood.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />


<h3>THE YOUNG MAN&#8217;S DREAM.</h3>

<p>This song is the composition of Balloon Tytler.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />


<h3>STRATHALLAN&#8217;S LAMENT.</h3>

<p>This air in the composition of one of the worthiest and best-hearted
men living&mdash;Allan Masterton, schoolmaster in Edinburgh. As he and I
were both sprouts of Jacobitism we agreed to dedicate the words and
air to that cause.</p>

<p>To tell the matter-of-fact, except when my passions were heated by
some accidental cause, my Jacobitism was merely by way of <i>vive la
bagatelle.</i></p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />


<h3>UP IN THE MORNING EARLY.</h3>

<p>The chorus of this is old; the two stanzas are mine.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />


<h3>THE TEARS OF SCOTLAND.</h3>

<p>Dr. Blacklock told me that Smollet, who was at the bottom a great
Jacobite, composed these beautiful and pathetic verses on the infamous
depredations of the Duke of Cumberland after the battle of Culloden.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />


<h3>WHAT WILL I DO GIN MY HOGGIE DIE.</h3>

<p>Dr. Walker, who was minister at Moffat in 1772, and is now (1791)
Professor of Natural History in the University of Edinburgh, told the
following anecdote concerning this air.&mdash;He said, that some gentlemen,
riding a few years ago through Liddesdale, stopped at a hamlet
consisting of a few houses, called Moss Platt, when they were struck
with this tune, which an old woman, spinning on a rock at her door,
was singing. All she could tell concerning it was, that she was taught
it when a child, and it was called &#8220;What will I do gin my Hoggie die?&#8221;
No person, except a few females at Moss Platt, knew this fine old
tune, which in all probability would have been lost had not one of the
gentlemen, who happened to have a flute with him, taken it down.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />


<h3>I DREAM&#8217;D I LAY WHERE FLOWERS WERE SPRINGING.</h3>

<p>These two stanzas I composed when I was seventeen, and are among the
oldest of my printed pieces.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />


<h3>AH! THE POOR SHEPHERD&#8217;S MOURNFUL FATE.</h3>

<p class="std1">Tune&mdash;&#8220;Gallashiels.&#8221;</p>

<p>The old title, &#8220;Sour Plums o&#8217; Gallashiels,&#8221; probably was the beginning
of a song to this air, which is now lost.</p>

<p>The tune of Gallashiels was composed about the beginning of the
present century by the Laird of Gallashiel&#8217;s piper.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />


<h3>THE BANKS OF THE DEVON.</h3>

<p>These verses were composed on a charming girl, a Miss Charlotte
Hamilton, who is now married to James M&#8217;Kitrick Adair, Esq.,
physician. She is sister to my worthy friend Gavin Hamilton, of
Mauchline, and was born on the banks of the Ayr, but was, at the time
I wrote these lines, residing at Herveyston, in Clackmannanshire, on
the romantic banks of the little river Devon. I first heard the air
from a lady in Inverness, and got the notes taken down for this work.</p>

<h3>MILL, MILL O.</h3>

<p>The original, or at least a song evidently prior to Ramsay&#8217;s is still
extant.&mdash;It runs thus,</p>

<p class="std2"><span class="smcap">Chorus</span>.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<h3>WE RAN AND THEY RAN.</h3>

<p>The author of &#8220;We ran and they ran&#8221;&mdash;was a Rev. Mr. Murdoch M&#8217;Lennan,
minister at Crathie, Dee-side.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />


<h3>WALY, WALY.</h3>

<p>In the west country I have heard a different edition of the second
stanza.&mdash;Instead of the four lines, beginning with, &#8220;When
cockle-shells, &amp;c.,&#8221; the other way ran thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;O wherefore need I busk my head,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Or wherefore need I kame my hair,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">And sys, he&#8217;ll never luve me mair.&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />


<h3>DUNCAN GRAY.</h3>

<p>Dr. Blacklock informed me that he had often heard the tradition, that
this air was composed by a carman in Glasgow.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />


<h3>DUMBARTON DRUMS.</h3>

<p>This is the last of the West-Highland airs; and from it over the whole
tract of country to the confines of Tweedside, there is hardly a tune
or song that one can say has taken its origin from any place or
transaction in that part of Scotland.&mdash;The oldest Ayrshire reel, is
Stewarton Lasses, which was made by the father of the present Sir
Walter Montgomery Cunningham, alias Lord Lysle; since which period
there has indeed been local music in that country in great
plenty.&mdash;Johnie Faa is the only old song which I could ever trace as
belonging to the extensive county of Ayr.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />


<h3>CAULD KAIL IN ABERDEEN.</h3>

<p>This song is by the Duke of Gordon.&mdash;The old verses are,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;There&#8217;s cauld kail in Aberdeen,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And castocks in Strathbogie;<br /></span>

<p class="std2"><span class="smcap">Chorus</span>.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">My coggie, Sirs, my coggie, Sirs,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I cannot want my coggie;<br /></span>

<h3>FOR LAKE OF GOLD.</h3>

<p>The country girls in Ayrshire, instead of the line&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;She me forsook for a great duke,&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>say</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;For Athole&#8217;s duke she me forsook;&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>which I take to be the original reading.</p>

<p>These were composed by the late Dr. Austin, physician at
Edinburgh.&mdash;He had courted a lady, to whom he was shortly to have been
married; but the Duke of Athole having seen her, became so much in
love with her, that he made proposals of marriage, which were accepted
of, and she jilted the doctor.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />


<h3>HERE&#8217;S A HEALTH TO MY TRUE LOVE, &amp;c.</h3>

<p>This song is Dr. Blacklock&#8217;s. He told me that tradition gives the air
to our James IV. of Scotland.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />


<h3>HEY TUTTI TAITI.</h3>

<p>I Have met the tradition universally over Scotland, and particularly
about Stirling, in the neighbourhood of the scene, that this air was
Robert Bruce&#8217;s march at the battle of Bannockburn.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />


<h3>RAVING WINDS AROUND HER BLOWING.</h3>

<p>I Composed these verses on Miss Isabella M&#8217;Leod, of Raza, alluding to
her feelings on the death of her sister, and the still more melancholy
death of her sister&#8217;s husband, the late Earl of Loudon; who shot
himself out of sheer heart-break at some mortifications he suffered,
owing to the deranged state of his finances.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />


<h3>TAK YOUR AULD CLOAK ABOUT YE.</h3>

<p>A part of this old song, according to the English set of it, is quoted
in Shakspeare.</p>

<h3>YE GODS, WAS STREPHON&#8217;S PICTURE BLEST?</h3>

<p class="std1">Tune&mdash;&#8220;Fourteenth of October.&#8221;</p>

<p>The title of this air shows that it alludes to the famous king
Crispian, the patron of the honourable corporation of shoemakers.&mdash;St.
Crispian&#8217;s day falls on the fourteenth of October old style, as the
old proverb tells:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;On the fourteenth of October<br /></span>

<h3>SINCE ROBB&#8217;D OF ALL THAT CHARM&#8217;D MY VIEWS.</h3>

<p>The old name of this air is, &#8220;the Blossom o&#8217; the Raspberry.&#8221; The song
is Dr. Blacklock&#8217;s.</p>

<h3>YOUNG DAMON.</h3>

<p>This air is by Oswald.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />


<h3>KIRK WAD LET ME BE.</h3>

<p>Tradition in the western parts of Scotland tells that this old song,
of which there are still three stanzas extant, once saved a
covenanting clergyman out of a scrape. It was a little prior to the
revolution, a period when being a Scots covenanter was being a felon,
that one of their clergy, who was at that very time hunted by the
merciless soldiery, fell in, by accident, with a party of the
military. The soldiers were not exactly acquainted with the person of
the reverend gentleman of whom they were in search; but from
suspicious circumstances, they fancied that they had got one of that
cloth and opprobrious persuasion among them in the person of this
stranger. &#8220;Mass John&#8221; to extricate himself, assumed a freedom of
manners, very unlike the gloomy strictness of his sect; and among
other convivial exhibitions, sung (and some traditions say, composed
on the spur of the occasion) &#8220;Kirk wad let me be,&#8221; with such effect,
that the soldiers swore he was a d&mdash;&mdash;d honest fellow, and that it
was impossible <i>he</i> could belong to those hellish conventicles; and so
gave him his liberty.</p>

<p>The first stanza of this song, a little altered, is a favourite kind
of dramatic interlude acted at country weddings, in the south-west
parts of the kingdom. A young fellow is dressed up like an old beggar;
a peruke, commonly made of carded tow, represents hoary locks; an old
bonnet; a ragged plaid, or surtout, bound with a straw rope for a
girdle; a pair of old shoes, with straw ropes twisted round his
ankles, as is done by shepherds in snowy weather: his face they
disguise as like wretched old age as they can: in this plight he is
brought into the wedding-house, frequently to the astonishment of
strangers, who are not in the secret, and begins to sing&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;O, I am a silly auld man,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">My name it is auld Glenae,&#8221; &amp;c.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>He is asked to drink, and by and bye to dance, which after some
uncouth excuses he is prevailed on to do, the fiddler playing the
tune, which here is commonly called &#8220;Auld Glenae;&#8221; in short he is all
the time so plied with liquor that he is understood to get
intoxicated, and with all the ridiculous gesticulations of an old
drunken beggar, he dances and staggers until he falls on the floor;
yet still in all his riot, nay, in his rolling and tumbling on the
floor, with some or other drunken motion of his body, he beats time to
the music, till at last he is supposed to be carried out dead drunk.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />


<h3>MUSING ON THE ROARING OCEAN.</h3>

<p>I composed these verses out of compliment to a Mrs. M&#8217;Lachlan, whose
husband is an officer in the East Indies.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />


<h3>BLYTHE WAS SHE.</h3>

<p>I composed these verses while I stayed at Ochtertyre with Sir William
Murray.&mdash;The lady, who was also at Ochtertyre at the same time, was
the well-known toast, Miss Euphemia Murray, of Lentrose; she was
called, and very justly, &#8220;The Flower of Strathmore.&#8221;</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />


<h3>JOHNNIE FAA, OR THE GYPSIE LADDIE.</h3>

<p>The people in Ayrshire begin this song&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;The gypsies cam to my Lord Cassilis&#8217; yett.&#8221;&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>They have a great many more stanzas in this song than I ever yet saw
in any printed copy.&mdash;The castle is still remaining at Maybole, where
his lordship shut up his wayward spouse, and kept her for life.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />


<h3>TO DAUNTON ME.</h3>

<p>The two following old stanzas to this tune have some merit:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;To daunton me, to daunton me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O ken ye what it is that&#8217;ll daunton me?&mdash;<br /></span>

<h3>THE BONNIE LASS MADE THE BED TO ME.</h3>

<p>&#8220;The Bonnie Lass made the Bed to me,&#8221; was composed on an amour of
Charles II. when skulking in the North, about Aberdeen, in the time of

<h3>ABSENCE.</h3>

<h3>I HAD A HORSE AND I HAD NAE MAIR.</h3>

<p>This story is founded on fact. A John Hunter, ancestor to a very
respectable farming family, who live in a place in the parish, I
think, of Galston, called Bar-mill, was the luckless hero that &#8220;had a
horse and had nae mair.&#8221;&mdash;For some little youthful follies he found it
necessary to make a retreat to the West-Highlands, where &#8220;he feed
himself to a <i>Highland</i> Laird,&#8221; for that is the expression of all the
oral editions of the song I ever heard.&mdash;The present Mr. Hunter, who
told me the anecdote, is the great-grandchild of our hero.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />


<h3>UP AND WARN A&#8217; WILLIE.</h3>

<p>This edition of the song I got from Tom Niel, of facetious fame, in
Edinburgh. The expression &#8220;Up and warn a&#8217; Willie,&#8221; alludes to the
Crantara, or warning of a Highland clan to arms. Not understanding
this, the Lowlanders in the west and south say, &#8220;Up and <i>waur</i> them
a&#8217;,&#8221; &amp;c.</p>

<h3>A ROSE-BUD BY MY EARLY WALK.</h3>

<p>This song I composed on Miss Jenny Cruikshank, only child of my worthy
friend Mr. William Cruikshank, of the High-School, Edinburgh. This air
is by a David Sillar, quondam merchant, and now schoolmaster in
Irvine. He is the <i>Davie</i> to whom I address my printed poetical
epistle in the measure of the Cherry and the Slae.</p>

<h3>AULD ROB MORRIS.</h3>

<p>It is remark-worthy that the song of &#8220;Holy and Fairly,&#8221; in all the old
editions of it, is called &#8220;The Drunken Wife o&#8217; Galloway,&#8221; which
localizes it to that country.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />


<h3>RATTLIN, ROARIN WILLIE.</h3>

<p>The last stanza of this song is mine; it was composed out of
compliment to one of the worthiest fellows in the world, William
Dunbar, Esq., writer to the signet, Edinburgh, and Colonel of the
Crochallan Corps, a club of wits who took that title at the time of
raising the fencible regiments.</p>

<h3>TUNE YOUR FIDDLES, ETC.</h3>

<p>This song was composed by the Rev. John Skinner, nonjuror clergyman at
Linshart, near Peterhead. He is likewise author of &#8220;Tullochgorum,&#8221;
&#8220;Ewie wi&#8217; the crooked Horn,&#8221; &#8220;John o&#8217; Badenyond,&#8221; &amp;c., and what is of
still more consequence, he is one of the worthiest of mankind. He is
the author of an ecclesiastical history of Scotland. The air is by Mr.
Marshall, butler to the Duke of Gordon; the first composer of
strathspeys of the age. I have been told by somebody, who had it of
Marshall himself, that he took the idea of his three most celebrated
pieces, &#8220;The Marquis of Huntley&#8217;s<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_515" id="Page_515">[515]</a></span> Reel,&#8221; his &#8220;Farewell,&#8221; and &#8220;Miss
Admiral Gordon&#8217;s Reel,&#8221; from the old air, &#8220;The German Lairdie.&#8221;</p>

<h3>GILL MORICE.</h3>

<p>This plaintive ballad ought to have been called Child Maurice, and not
Gil Maurice. In its present dress, it has gained immortal honour from
Mr. Home&#8217;s taking from it the ground-work of his fine tragedy of
Douglas. But I am of opinion that the present ballad is a modern
composition; perhaps not much above the age of the middle of the last
century; at least I should be glad to see or hear of a copy of the
present words prior to 1650. That it was taken from an old ballad,
called &#8220;Child Maurice,&#8221; now lost, I am inclined to believe; but the
present one may be classed with &#8220;Hardyknute,&#8221; &#8220;Kenneth,&#8221; &#8220;Duncan, the
Laird of Woodhouselie,&#8221; &#8220;Lord Livingston,&#8221; &#8220;Binnorie,&#8221; &#8220;The Death of
Monteith,&#8221; and many other modern productions, which have been
swallowed by many readers as ancient fragments of old poems. This
beautiful plaintive tune was composed by Mr. M&#8217;Gibbon, the selector of
a collection of Scots tunes. R. B.</p>

<p>In addition to the observations on Gil Morice, I add, that of the
songs which Captain Riddel mentions, &#8220;Kenneth&#8221; and &#8220;Duncan&#8221; are
juvenile compositions of Mr. M&#8217;Kenzie, &#8220;The Man of
Feeling.&#8221;&mdash;M&#8217;Kenzie&#8217;s father showed them in MS. to Dr. Blacklock, as
the productions of his son, from which the Doctor rightly
prognosticated that the young poet would make, in his more advanced
years, a respectable figure in the world of letters.</p>

<p>This I had from Blacklock.</p>

<h3>TIBBIE DUNBAR.</h3>

<p>This tune is said to be the composition of John M&#8217;Gill, fiddler, in
Girvan. He called it after his own name.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />


<h3>WHEN I UPON THY BOSOM LEAN.</h3>

<p>This song was the work of a very worthy facetious old fellow, John
Lapraik, late of Dalfram, near Muirkirk; which little property he was
obliged to sell in consequence of some connexion as security for some
persons concerned in that villanous bubble <span class="smcap">the ayr bank</span>. He
has often told me that he composed this song one day when his wife had
been fretting o&#8217;er their misfortunes.</p>

<h3>MY HARRY WAS A GALLANT GAY.</h3>

<p class="std1">Tune&mdash;&#8220;Highlander&#8217;s Lament.&#8221;</p>

<p>The oldest title I ever heard to this air, was, &#8220;The Highland Watch&#8217;s
Farewell to Ireland.&#8221; The chorus I picked up from an old woman in
Dumblane; the rest of the song is mine.</p>

<h3>THE HIGHLAND CHARACTER.</h3>

<p>This tune was the composition of Gen. Reid, and called by him &#8220;The

Erskine.</p>

<h3>LEADER-HAUGHS AND YARROW.</h3>

<p>There is in several collections, the old song of &#8220;Leader-Haughs and

minstrels, as he calls himself, at the conclusion of his song,
&#8220;Minstrel Burn.&#8221;</p>

worthiest married couples in the world, Robert Riddel, Esq., of
Glenriddel, and his lady. At their fire-side I have enjoyed more
pleasant evenings than at all the houses of fashionable people in this
country put together; and to their kindness and hospitality I am
indebted for many of the happiest hours of my life.</p>

<h3>THE GABERLUNZIE MAN.</h3>

<p>The &#8220;Gaberlunzie Man&#8221; is supposed to commemorate an intrigue of James
the Fifth. Mr. Callander, of Craigforth, published some years ago an
edition of &#8220;Christ&#8217;s Kirk on the Green,&#8221; and the &#8220;Gaberlunzie Man,&#8221;
with notes critical and historical. James the Fifth is said to have
been fond of Gosford, in Aberlady parish, and that it was suspected by
his contemporaries, that in his frequent excursions to that part of
the country, he had other purposes in view besides golfing and
archery. Three favourite ladies, Sandilands, Weir, and Oliphant (one
of them resided at Gosford, and the others in the neighbourhood), were
occasionally visited by their royal and gallant admirer, which gave
rise to the following advice to his majesty, from Sir David Lindsay,
of the Mount, Lord Lyon.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;Sow not your seed on Sandylands,<br /></span>

<h3>A WAUKRIFE MINNIE.</h3>

<p>I picked up this old song and tune from a country girl in
Nithsdale.&mdash;I never met with it elsewhere in Scotland.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<h3>TULLOCHGORUM.</h3>

<p>This first of songs, is the master-piece of my old friend Skinner. He
was passing the day,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_519" id="Page_519">[519]</a></span> at the town of Cullen, I think it was, in a
friend&#8217;s house whose name was Montgomery. Mrs. Montgomery observing,
<i>en passant</i>, that the beautiful reel of Tullochgorum wanted words,
she begged them of Mr. Skinner, who gratified her wishes, and the
wishes of every Scottish song, in this most excellent ballad.</p>

<p>These particulars I had from the author&#8217;s son, Bishop Skinner, at
Aberdeen.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />


<h3>FOR A&#8217; THAT AND A&#8217; THAT.</h3>

<p>This song is mine, all except the chorus.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />


<h3>AULD LANG SYNE.</h3>

<p>Ramsay here, as usual with him, has taken the idea of the song, and
the first line, from the old fragment which may be seen in the
&#8220;Museum,&#8221; vol. v.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />


<h3>WILLIE BREW&#8217;D A PECK O&#8217; MAUT.</h3>

<p>This air is Masterton&#8217;s; the song mine.&mdash;The occasion of it was
this:&mdash;Mr. W. Nicol, of the High-School, Edinburgh, during the autumn
vacation being at Moffat, honest Allan, who was at that time on a
visit to Dalswinton, and I, went to pay Nicol a visit.&mdash;We had such a
joyous meeting that Mr. Masterton and I agreed, each in our own way,
that we should celebrate the business.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />


<h3>KILLIECRANKIE.</h3>

<p>The battle of Killiecrankie was the last stand made by the clans for
James, after his abdication. Here the gallant Lord Dundee fell in the
moment of victory, and with him fell the hopes of the party. General
Mackay, when he found the Highlanders did not pursue his flying army,
said, &#8220;Dundee must be killed, or he never would have overlooked this
advantage.&#8221; A great stone marks the spot where Dundee fell.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />


<h3>THE EWIE WI&#8217; THE CROOKED HORN.</h3>

<p>Another excellent song of old Skinner&#8217;s.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />


<h3>CRAIGIE-BURN WOOD.</h3>

<p>It is remarkable of this air that it is the confine of that country
where the greatest part of our Lowland music (so far as from the
title, words, &amp;c., we can localize it) has been composed. From
Craigie-burn, near Moffat, until one reaches the West Highlands, we
have scarcely one slow air of any antiquity.</p>

<p>The song was composed on a passion which a Mr. Gillespie, a particular
friend of mine, had for a Miss Lorimer, afterwards a Mrs. Whelpdale.
This young lady was born at Craigie-burn Wood.&mdash;The chorus is part of
an old foolish ballad.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />


<h3>FRAE THE FRIENDS AND LAND I LOVE.</h3>

<p>I added the four last lines, by way of giving a turn to the theme of
the poem, such as it is.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />


<h3>HUGHIE GRAHAM</h3>

<p>There are several editions of this ballad.&mdash;This, here inserted, is
from oral tradition in Ayrshire, where, when I was a boy, it was a
popular song.&mdash;It originally had a simple old tune, which I have
forgotten.</p>

<h3>A SOUTHLAND JENNY.</h3>

<p>This is a popular Ayrshire song, though the notes were never taken
down before. It, as well as many of the ballad tunes in this
collection, was written from Mrs. Burns&#8217;s voice.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />


<h3>MY TOCHER&#8217;S THE JEWEL.</h3>

<p>This tune is claimed by Nathaniel Gow.&mdash;It is notoriously taken from
&#8220;The muckin o&#8217; Gordie&#8217;s byre.&#8221;&mdash;It is also to be found long prior to
Nathaniel Gow&#8217;s era, in Aird&#8217;s Selection of Airs and Marches, the
first edition under the name of &#8220;The Highway to Edinburgh.&#8221;</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />


<h3>THEN, GUID WIFE, COUNT THE LAWIN&#8217;.</h3>

<p>The chorus of this is part of an old song, no stanza of which I
recollect.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />


<h3>THERE&#8217;LL NEVER BE PEACE TILL JAMIE COMES HAME.</h3>

<p>This tune is sometimes called &#8220;There&#8217;s few gude fellows when Willie&#8217;s
awa.&#8221;&mdash;But I never have been able to meet with anything else of the
song than the title.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />


<h3>I DO CONFESS THOU ART SAE FAIR.</h3>

<p>This song is altered from a poem by Sir Robert Ayton, private
secretary to Mary and Ann, Queens of Scotland.&mdash;The poem is to be
found in James Watson&#8217;s Collection of Scots Poems, the earliest
collection printed in Scotland. I think that I have improved the
simplicity of the sentiments, by giving them a Scots dress.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />


<h3>THE SODGER LADDIE.</h3>

<p>The first verse of this is old; the rest is by Ramsay. The tune seems
to be the same with a slow air, called &#8220;Jackey Hume&#8217;s Lament&#8221;&mdash;or,
&#8220;The Hollin Buss&#8221;&mdash;or &#8220;Ken ye what Meg o&#8217; the Mill has gotten?&#8221;</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />


<h3>WHERE WAD BONNIE ANNIE LIE.</h3>

<p>The old name of this tune is,&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot">&#8220;Whare&#8217;ll our gudeman lie.&#8221;</p>

<p>A silly old stanza of it runs thus&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;O whare&#8217;ll our gudeman lie,<br /></span>

<h3>GALLOWAY TAM.</h3>

<p>I have seen an interlude (acted at a wedding) to this tune, called
&#8220;The Wooing of the Maiden.&#8221; These entertainments are now much worn out
in this part of Scotland. Two are still retained in Nithsdale, viz.
&#8220;Silly Pure Auld Glenae,&#8221; and this one, &#8220;The Wooing of the Maiden.&#8221;</p>

<h3>AS I CAM DOWN BY YON CASTLE WA.</h3>

<p>This is a very popular Ayrshire song.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />


<h3>LORD RONALD MY SON.</h3>

<p>This air, a very favourite one in Ayrshire, is evidently the original
of Lochaber. In this manner most of our finest more modern airs have
had their origin. Some early minstrel, or musical shepherd, composed
the simple, artless original air; which being picked up by the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_521" id="Page_521">[521]</a></span> more
learned musician, took the improved form it bears.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />


<h3>O&#8217;ER THE MOOR AMANG THE HEATHER.</h3>

<p>This song is the composition of a Jean Glover, a girl who was not only
a whore, but also a thief; and in one or other character has visited
most of the Correction Houses in the West. She was born I believe in
Kilmarnock,&mdash;I took the song down from her singing, as she was
strolling through the country, with a sleight-of-hand blackguard.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />


<h3>TO THE ROSE-BUD.</h3>

<p>This song is the composition of a &mdash;&mdash; Johnson, a joiner in the
neighbourhood of Belfast. The tune is by Oswald, altered, evidently,
from &#8220;Jockie&#8217;s Gray Breeks.&#8221;</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />


<h3>YON WILD MOSSY MOUNTAINS.</h3>

<p>This tune is by Oswald. The song alludes to a part of my private
history, which it is of no consequence to the world to know.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />


<h3>IT IS NA, JEAN, THY BONNIE FACE.</h3>

<p>These were originally English verses:&mdash;I gave them the Scots dress.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />


<h3>EPPIE M&#8217;NAB.</h3>

<p>The old song with this title has more wit than decency.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />


<h3>WHA IS THAT AT MY BOWER DOOR.</h3>

<p>This tune is also known by the name of &#8220;Lass an I come near thee.&#8221; The
words are mine.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />


<h3>THOU ART GANE AWA.</h3>

<p>This time is the same with &#8220;Haud awa frae me, Donald.&#8221;</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />


<h3>THE TEARS I SHED MUST EVER FALL.</h3>

<p>This song of genius was composed by a Miss Cranston. It wanted four
lines, to make all the stanzas suit the music, which I added, and are
the four first of the last stanza.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;No cold approach, no alter&#8217;d mien,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Just what would make suspicion start;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No pause the dire extremes between,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He made me blest&mdash;and broke my heart!&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />


<h3>THE BONIE WEE THING.</h3>

<p>Composed on my little idol &#8220;the charming, lovely Davies.&#8221;</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />


<h3>THE TITHER MORN.</h3>

<p>This tune is originally from the Highlands. I have heard a Gaelic song
to it, which I was told was very clever, but not by any means a lady&#8217;s
song.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />


<h3>A MOTHER&#8217;S LAMENT FOR THE DEATH OF HER SON.</h3>

<p>This most beautiful tune is, I think, the happiest composition of that
bard-born genius, John Riddel, of the family of Glencarnock, at Ayr.
The words were composed to commemorate the much-lamented and premature
death of James Ferguson, Esq., jun. of Craigdarroch.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />


<h3>DAINTIE DAVIE.</h3>

<p>This song, tradition says, and the composition itself confirms it, was
composed on the Rev. David Williamson&#8217;s begetting the daughter of Lady
Cherrytrees with child, while a party of dragoons were searching her
house to apprehend him for being an adherent to the solemn league and
covenant. The pious woman had put a lady&#8217;s night-cap on him, and had
laid him a-bed with her own daughter, and passed him to the soldiery
as a lady, her daughter&#8217;s bed-fellow. A mutilated stanza or two are to
be found in Herd&#8217;s collection, but the original song consists of five
or six stanzas, and were their <i>delicacy</i> equal to their <i>wit</i> and
<i>humour</i>, they would merit a place in any collection. The first stanza
is</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;Being pursued by the dragoons,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Within my bed he was laid down;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And weel I wat he was worth his room,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For he was my Daintie Davie.&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Ramsay&#8217;s song, &#8220;Luckie Nansy,&#8221; though he calls it an old song with
additions, seems to be all his own except the chorus:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;I was a telling you,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Luckie Nansy, Luckie Nansy<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_522" id="Page_522">[522]</a></span><span class="i0">Auld springs wad ding the new,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But ye wad never trow me.&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Which I should conjecture to be part of a song prior to the affair of
Williamson.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />


<h3>BOB O&#8217; DUMBLANE.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Ramsay</span>, as usual, has modernized this song. The original,
which I learned on the spot, from my old hostess in the principal inn
there, is&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;Lassie, lend me your braw hemp heckle,<br /></span>

<p>I insert this song to introduce the following anecdote, which I have
heard well authenticated. In the evening of the day of the battle of
Dumblane, (Sheriff Muir,) when the action was over, a Scots officer in
Argyll&#8217;s army, observed to His Grace, that he was afraid the rebels
would give out to the world that <i>they</i> had gotten the
victory.&mdash;&#8220;Weel, weel,&#8221; returned his Grace, alluding to the foregoing
ballad, &#8220;if they think it be nae weel bobbit, we&#8217;ll bob it again.&#8221;</p>

<p>Left Edinburgh (May 6, 1787)&mdash;Lammermuir-hills miserably dreary, but
at times very picturesque. Lanton-edge, a glorious view of the
Merse&mdash;Reach Berrywell&mdash;old Mr. Ainslie an uncommon character;&mdash;his
hobbies, agriculture, natural philosophy, and politics.&mdash;In the first
he is unexceptionably the clearest-headed, best-informed man I ever
met with; in the other two, very intelligent:&mdash;As a man of business he
has uncommon merit, and by fairly deserving it has made a very decent
independence. Mrs. Ainslie, an excellent, sensible, cheerful, amiable
old woman&mdash;Miss Ainslie&mdash;her person a little <i>embonpoint</i>, but
handsome; her face, particularly her eyes, full of sweetness and good
humour&mdash;she unites three qualities rarely to be found together; keen,
solid penetration; sly, witty observation and remark; and the
gentlest, most unaffected female modesty&mdash;Douglas, a clever, fine,
promising young fellow.&mdash;The family-meeting with their brother; my
<i>compagnon de voyage</i>, very charming; particularly the sister. The
whole family remarkably attached to their menials&mdash;Mrs. A. full of
stories of the sagacity and sense of the little girl in the
kitchen.&mdash;Mr. A. high in the praises of an African, his
house-servant&mdash;all his people old in his service&mdash;Douglas&#8217;s old nurse
came to Berrywell yesterday to remind them of its being his birthday.</p>

<p>A Mr. Dudgeon, a poet at times,<a name="FNanchor_294_294" id="FNanchor_294_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a> a worthy remarkable
character&mdash;natural penetration, a great deal of information, some
genius, and extreme modesty.</p>

<p><i>Sunday.</i>&mdash;Went to church at Dunse<a name="FNanchor_295_295" id="FNanchor_295_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a>&mdash;Dr. Howmaker a man of strong
lungs and pretty judicious remark; but ill skilled in propriety, and
altogether unconscious of his want of it.</p>

<p><i>Monday.</i>&mdash;Coldstream&mdash;went over to England&mdash;Cornhill&mdash;glorious river
Tweed&mdash;clear and majestic&mdash;fine bridge. Dine at Coldstream with <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_523" id="Page_523">[523]</a></span>Mr. Ainslie and Mr. Foreman&mdash;beat Mr. F&mdash;&mdash; in a dispute about
Voltaire. Tea at Lenel House with Mr. Brydone&mdash;Mr. Brydone a most
excellent heart, kind, joyous, and benevolent; but a good deal of the
French indiscriminate complaisance&mdash;from his situation past and
present, an admirer of everything that bears a splendid title, or that
possesses a large estate&mdash;Mrs. Brydone a most elegant woman in her
person and manners; the tones of her voice remarkably sweet&mdash;my
reception extremely flattering&mdash;sleep at Coldstream.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday.</i>&mdash;Breakfast at Kelso&mdash;charming situation of Kelso&mdash;fine
bridge over the Tweed&mdash;enchanting views and prospects on both sides of
the river, particularly the Scotch side; introduced to Mr. Scott of
the Royal Bank&mdash;an excellent, modest fellow&mdash;fine situation of
it&mdash;ruins of Roxburgh Castle&mdash;a holly-bush, growing where James II. of
Scotland was accidentally killed by the bursting of a cannon. A small
old religious ruin, and a fine old garden planted by the religious,
rooted out and destroyed by an English hottentot, a <i>maitre d&#8217;hotel</i>
of the duke&#8217;s, a Mr. Cole&mdash;climate and soil of Berwickshire, and even
Roxburghshire, superior to Ayrshire&mdash;bad roads. Turnip and sheep
husbandry, their great improvements&mdash;Mr. M&#8217;Dowal, at Caverton Mill, a
friend of Mr. Ainslie&#8217;s, with whom I dined to-day, sold his sheep, ewe
and lamb together, at two guineas a piece&mdash;wash their sheep before
shearing&mdash;seven or eight pounds of washen wool in a fleece&mdash;low
markets, consequently low rents&mdash;fine lands not above sixteen
shillings a Scotch acre&mdash;magnificence of farmers and farm-houses&mdash;come
up Teviot and up Jed to Jedburgh to lie, and so wish myself a good
night.</p>

<p><i>Wednesday.</i>&mdash;Breakfast with Mr. &mdash;&mdash; in Jedburgh&mdash;a squabble between
Mrs. &mdash;&mdash;, a crazed, talkative slattern, and a sister of hers, an old
maid, respecting a relief minister&mdash;Miss gives Madam the lie; and
Madam, by way of revenge, upbraids her that she laid snares to
entangle the said minister, then a widower, in the net of
matrimony&mdash;go about two miles out of Jedburgh to a roup of parks&mdash;meet
a polite, soldier-like gentleman, a Captain Rutherford, who had been
many years through the wilds of America, a prisoner among the
Indians&mdash;charming, romantic situation of Jedburgh, with gardens,
orchards, &amp;c., intermingled among the houses&mdash;fine old ruins&mdash;a once
magnificent cathedral, and strong castle. All the towns here have the
appearance of old, rude grandeur, but the people extremely idle&mdash;Jed a
fine romantic little river.</p>

<p>Dine with Capt. Rutherford&mdash;the Captain a polite fellow, fond of money
in his farming way; showed a particular respect to my bardship&mdash;his
lady exactly a proper matrimonial second part for him. Miss Rutherford
a beautiful girl, but too far gone woman to expose so much of a fine
swelling bosom&mdash;her face very fine.</p>

<p>Return to Jedburgh&mdash;walk up Jed with some ladies to be shown Love-lane
and Blackburn, two fairy scenes. Introduced to Mr. Potts, writer, a
very clever fellow; and Mr. Somerville, the clergyman of the place, a
man and a gentleman, but sadly addicted to punning.&mdash;The walking party
of ladies, Mrs. &mdash;&mdash; and Miss &mdash;&mdash; her sister, before mentioned.&mdash;N.B.
These two appear still more comfortably ugly and stupid, and bore me
most shockingly. Two Miss &mdash;&mdash;, tolerably agreeable. Miss Hope, a
tolerably pretty girl, fond of laughing and fun. Miss Lindsay, a
good-humoured, amiable girl; rather short <i>et embonpoint</i>, but
handsome, and extremely graceful&mdash;beautiful hazel eyes, full of
spirit, and sparkling with delicious moisture&mdash;an engaging face&mdash;<i>un
tout ensemble</i> that speaks her of the first order of female minds&mdash;her
sister, a bonnie, strappan, rosy, sonsie lass. Shake myself loose,
after several unsuccessful efforts, of Mrs. &mdash;&mdash; and Miss &mdash;&mdash;, and
somehow or other, get hold of Miss Lindsay&#8217;s arm. My heart is thawed
into melting pleasure after being so long frozen up in the Greenland
bay of indifference, amid the noise and nonsense of Edinburgh. Miss
seems very well pleased with my bardship&#8217;s distinguishing her, and
after some slight qualms, which I could easily mark, she sets the
titter round at defiance, and kindly allows me to keep my hold; and
when parted by the ceremony of my introduction to Mr. Somerville, she
met me half, to resume my situation.&mdash;Nota Bene&mdash;The poet within a
point and a half of being d&mdash;mnably in love&mdash;I am afraid my bosom is
still nearly as much tinder as ever.</p>

<p>The old cross-grained, whiggish, ugly, slanderous Miss &mdash;&mdash;, with all
the poisonous spleen of a disappointed, ancient maid, stops me very
unseasonably to ease her bursting breast, by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_524" id="Page_524">[524]</a></span> falling abusively foul
on the Miss Lindsays, particularly on my Dulcinea;&mdash;I hardly refrain
from cursing her to her face for daring to mouth her calumnious
slander on one of the finest pieces of the workmanship of Almighty
Excellence! Sup at Mr. &mdash;&mdash;&#8217;s; vexed that the Miss Lindsays are not of
the supper-party, as they only are wanting. Mrs. &mdash;&mdash; and Miss &mdash;&mdash;still
improve infernally on my hands.</p>

<p>Set out next morning for Wauchope, the seat of my correspondent, Mrs.
Scott&mdash;breakfast by the way with Dr. Elliot, an agreeable,
good-hearted, climate-beaten old veteran, in the medical line; now
retired to a romantic, but rather moorish place, on the banks of the
Roole&mdash;he accompanies us almost to Wauchope&mdash;we traverse the country
to the top of Bochester, the scene of an old encampment, and Woolee
Hill.</p>

<p>Wauchope&mdash;Mr. Scott exactly the figure and face commonly given to
Sancho Panca&mdash;very shrewd in his farming matters, and not unfrequently
stumbles on what may be called a strong thing rather than a good
thing. Mrs. Scott all the sense, taste, intrepidity of face, and bold,
critical decision, which usually distinguish female authors.&mdash;Sup with
Mr. Potts&mdash;agreeable party.&mdash;Breakfast next morning with Mr.
Somerville&mdash;the <i>bruit</i> of Miss Lindsay and my bardship, by means of
the invention and malice of Miss &mdash;&mdash;. Mr. Somerville sends to Dr.
Lindsay, begging him and family to breakfast if convenient, but at all
events to send Miss Lindsay; accordingly Miss Lindsay only comes.&mdash;I
find Miss Lindsay would soon play the devil with me&mdash;I met with some
little flattering attentions from her. Mrs. Somerville an excellent,
motherly, agreeable woman, and a fine family.&mdash;Mr. Ainslie, and Mrs.
S&mdash;&mdash;, junrs., with Mr. &mdash;&mdash;, Miss Lindsay, and myself, go to see
<i>Esther</i>, a very remarkable woman for reciting poetry of all kinds,
and sometimes making Scotch doggerel herself&mdash;she can repeat by heart
almost everything she has ever read, particularly Pope&#8217;s Homer from
end to end&mdash;has studied Euclid by herself, and in short, is a woman of
very extraordinary abilities.&mdash;On conversing with her I find her fully
equal to the character given of her.<a name="FNanchor_296_296" id="FNanchor_296_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a>&mdash;She is very much flattered
that I send for her, and that she sees a poet who has <i>put out a
book</i>, as she says.&mdash;She is, among other things, a great florist&mdash;and
is rather past the meridian of once celebrated beauty.</p>

<p>I walk in <i>Esther&#8217;s</i> garden with Miss Lindsay, and after some little
chit-chat of the tender kind, I presented her with a proof print of my
Nob, which she accepted with something more tinder than gratitude. She
told me many little stories which Miss &mdash;&mdash; had retailed concerning her
and me, with prolonging pleasure&mdash;God bless her! Was waited on by the
magistrates, and presented with the freedom of the burgh.</p>

<p>Took farewell of Jedburgh, with some melancholy, disagreeable
sensations.&mdash;Jed, pure be thy crystal streams, and hallowed thy sylvan
banks! Sweet Isabella Lindsay, may peace dwell in thy bosom,
uninterrupted, except by the tumultuous throbbings of rapturous love!
That love-kindling eye must beam on another, not on me; that graceful
form must bless another&#8217;s arms; not mine!</p>

<p>Kelso. Dine with the farmers&#8217; club&mdash;all gentlemen, talking of high
matters&mdash;each of them keeps a hunter from thirty to fifty pounds
value, and attends the fox-huntings in the country&mdash;go out with Mr.
Ker, one of the club, and a friend of Mr. Ainslie&#8217;s, to lie&mdash;Mr. Ker a
most gentlemanly, clever, handsome fellow, a widower with some fine
children&mdash;his mind and manner astonishingly like my dear old friend
Robert Muir, in Kilmarnock&mdash;everything in Mr. Ker&#8217;s most elegant&mdash;he
offers to accompany me in my English tour. Dine with Sir Alexander
Don&mdash;a pretty clever fellow, but far from being a match for his divine
lady.&mdash;A very wet day * * *&mdash;Sleep at Stodrig again; and set out for
Melrose&mdash;visit Dryburgh, a fine old ruined abbey&mdash;still bad
weather&mdash;cross Leader, and come up Tweed to Melrose&mdash;dine there, and
visit that far-famed, glorious ruin&mdash;come to Selkirk, up Ettrick; the
whole country hereabout, both on Tweed and Ettrick, remarkably stony.</p>

<p><i>Monday.</i>&mdash;Come to Inverleithing, a famous shaw, and in the vicinity
of the palace of Traquair, where having dined, and drank some
Galloway-whey, I hero remain till to-morrow<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_525" id="Page_525">[525]</a></span>&mdash;saw Elibanks and
Elibraes, on the other side of the Tweed.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday.</i>&mdash;Drank tea yesternight at Pirn, with Mr.
Horseburgh.&mdash;Breakfasted to-day with Mr. Ballantyne of
Hollowlee&mdash;Proposal for a four-horse team to consist of Mr. Scott of
Wauchope, Fittieland: Logan of Logan, Fittiefurr: Ballantyne of
Hollowlee, Forewynd: Horsburgh of Horsburgh.&mdash;Dine at a country inn,
kept by a miller, in Earlston, the birth-place and residence of the
celebrated Thomas a Rhymer&mdash;saw the ruins of his castle&mdash;come to
Berrywell.</p>

<p><i>Wednesday.</i>&mdash;Dine at Dunse with the farmers&#8217; club-company&mdash;impossible
to do them justice&mdash;Rev. Mr. Smith a famous punster, and Mr. Meikle a
celebrated mechanic, and inventor of the threshing-mills.</p>

<p><i>Thursday</i>, breakfast at Berrywell, and walk into Dunse to see a
famous knife made by a cutler there, and to be presented to an Italian
prince.&mdash;A pleasant ride with my friend Mr. Robert Ainslie, and his
sister, to Mr. Thomson&#8217;s, a man who has newly commenced farmer, and
has married a Miss Patty Grieve, formerly a flame of Mr. Robert
Ainslie&#8217;s.&mdash;Company&mdash;Miss Jacky Grieve, an amiable sister of Mrs.
Thomson&#8217;s, and Mr. Hood, an honest, worthy, facetious farmer, in the
neighbourhood.</p>

<p><i>Friday.</i>&mdash;Ride to Berwick&mdash;An idle town, rudely picturesque.&mdash;Meet
Lord Errol in walking round the walls.&mdash;His lordship&#8217;s flattering
notice of me.&mdash;Dine with Mr. Clunzie, merchant&mdash;nothing particular in
company or conversation&mdash;Come up a bold shore, and over a wild country
to Eyemouth&mdash;sup and sleep at Mr. Grieve&#8217;s.</p>

<p><i>Saturday.</i>&mdash;Spend the day at Mr. Grieve&#8217;s&mdash;made a royal arch mason of
St. Abb&#8217;s Lodge,<a name="FNanchor_297_297" id="FNanchor_297_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a>&mdash;Mr. William Grieve, the oldest brother, a joyous,
warm-hearted, jolly, clever fellow&mdash;takes a hearty glass, and sings a
good song.&mdash;Mr. Robert, his brother, and partner in trade, a good
fellow, but says little. Take a sail after dinner. Fishing of all
kinds pays tithes at Eyemouth.</p>

<p><i>Sunday.</i>&mdash;A Mr. Robinson, brewer at Ednam, sets out with us to
Dunbar.</p>

<p>The Miss Grieves very good girls.&mdash;My bardship&#8217;s heart got a brush
from Miss Betsey.</p>

<p>Mr. William Grieve&#8217;s attachment to the family-circle, so fond, that
when he is out, which by the bye is often the case, he cannot go to
bed till he see if all his sisters are sleeping well &mdash;&mdash; Pass the
famous Abbey of Coldingham, and Pease-bridge.&mdash;Call at Mr. Sheriff&#8217;s
where Mr. A. and I dine.&mdash;Mr. S. talkative and conceited. I talk of
love to Nancy the whole evening, while her brother escorts home some
companions like himself.&mdash;Sir James Hall of Dunglass, having heard of
my being in the neighbourhood, comes to Mr. Sheriff&#8217;s to
breakfast&mdash;takes me to see his fine scenery on the stream of
Dunglass&mdash;Dunglass the most romantic, sweet place I over saw&mdash;Sir
James and his lady a pleasant happy couple.&mdash;He points out a walk for
which he has an uncommon respect, as it was made by an aunt of his, to
whom he owes much.</p>

<p>Miss &mdash;&mdash; will accompany me to Dunbar, by way of making a parade of me
as a sweetheart of hers, among her relations. She mounts an old
cart-horse, as huge and as lean as a house; a rusty old side-saddle
without girth, or stirrup, but fastened on with an old
pillion-girth&mdash;herself as fine as hands could make her, in
cream-coloured riding clothes, hat and feather, &amp;c.&mdash;I, ashamed of my
situation, ride like the devil, and almost shake her to pieces on old
Jolly&mdash;get rid of her by refusing to call at her uncle&#8217;s with her.</p>

<p>Past through the most glorious corn-country I ever saw, till I reach
Dunbar, a neat little town.&mdash;Dine with Provost Fall, an eminent
merchant, and most respectable character, but undescribable, as he
exhibits no marked traits. Mrs. Fall, a genius in painting; fully more
clever in the fine arts and sciences than my friend Lady Wauchope,
without her consummate
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_526" id="Page_526">[526]</a></span>
assurance of her own abilities.&mdash;Call with Mr. Robinson (who, by the
bye, I find to be a worthy, much respected man, very modest; warm,
social heart, which with less good sense than his would be perhaps
with the children of prim precision and pride, rather inimical to that
respect which is man&#8217;s due from man) with him I call on Miss Clarke, a
maiden in the Scotch phrase, &#8220;<i>Guid enough, but no brent new</i>:&#8221; a
clever woman, with tolerable pretensions to remark and wit; while time
had blown the blushing bud of bashful modesty into the flower of easy
confidence. She wanted to see what sort of <i>raree show</i> an author was;
and to let him know, that though Dunbar was but a little town, yet it
was not destitute of people of parts.</p>

<p>Breakfast next morning at Skateraw, at Mr. Lee&#8217;s, a farmer of great
note.&mdash;Mr. Lee, an excellent, hospitable, social fellow, rather
oldish; warm-hearted and chatty&mdash;a most judicious, sensible farmer.
Mr. Lee detains me till next morning.&mdash;Company at dinner.&mdash;My Rev.
acquaintance Dr. Bowmaker, a reverend, rattling old fellow.&mdash;Two sea
lieutenants; a cousin of the landlord&#8217;s, a fellow whose looks are of
that kind which deceived me in a gentleman at Kelso, and has often
deceived me: a goodly handsome figure and face, which incline one to
give them credit for parts which they have not. Mr. Clarke, a much
cleverer fellow, but whose looks a little cloudy, and his appearance
rather ungainly, with an every-day observer may prejudice the opinion
against him.&mdash;Dr. Brown, a medical young gentleman from Dunbar, a
fellow whose face and manners are open and engaging.&mdash;Leave Skateraw
for Dunse next day, along with collector &mdash;&mdash;, a lad of slender
abilities and bashfully diffident to an extreme.</p>

<p>Found Miss Ainslie, the amiable, the sensible, the good-humoured, the
sweet Miss Ainslie, all alone at Berrywell.&mdash;Heavenly powers, who know
the weakness of human hearts, support mine! What happiness must I see
only to remind me that I cannot enjoy it!</p>

<p>Lammer-muir Hills, from East Lothian to Dunse, very wild.&mdash;Dine with
the farmer&#8217;s club at Kelso. Sir John Hume and Mr. Lumsden there, but
nothing worth remembrance when the following circumstance is
considered&mdash;I walk into Dunse before dinner, and out to Berrywell in
the evening with Miss Ainslie&mdash;how well-bred, how frank, how good she
is! Charming Rachael! may thy bosom never be wrung by the evils of
this life of sorrows, or by the villany of this world&#8217;s sons!</p>

<p><i>Thursday.</i>&mdash;Mr. Ker and I set out to dine at Mr. Hood&#8217;s on our way to
England.</p>

<p>I am taken extremely ill with strong feverish symptoms, and take a
servant of Mr. Hood&#8217;s to watch me all night&mdash;embittering remorse
scares my fancy at the gloomy forebodings of death.&mdash;I am determined
to live for the future in such a manner as not to be scared at the
approach of death&mdash;I am sure I could meet him with indifference, but
for &#8220;The something beyond the grave.&#8221;&mdash;Mr. Hood agrees to accompany us
to England if we will wait till Sunday.</p>

<p><i>Friday.</i>&mdash;I go with Mr. Hood to see a roup of an unfortunate farmer&#8217;s
stock&mdash;rigid economy, and decent industry, do you preserve me from
being the principal <i>dramatis persona</i> in such a scene of horror.</p>

<p>Meet my good old friend Mr. Ainslie, who calls on Mr. Hood in the
evening to take farewell of my bardship. This day I feel myself warm
with sentiments of gratitude to the Great Preserver of men, who has
kindly restored me to health and strength once more.</p>

<p>A pleasant walk with my young friend Douglas Ainslie, a sweet, modest,
clever young fellow.</p>

<p><i>Sunday</i>, 27<i>th May.</i>&mdash;Cross Tweed, and traverse the moors through a
wild country till I reach Alnwick&mdash;Alnwick Castle a seat of the Duke
of Northumberland, furnished in a most princely manner.&mdash;A Mr. Wilkin,
agent of His Grace&#8217;s, shows us the house and policies. Mr. Wilkin, a
discreet, sensible, ingenious man.</p>

<p><i>Monday.</i>&mdash;Come, still through by-ways, to Warkworth, where we
dine.&mdash;Hermitage and old castle. Warkworth situated very picturesque,
with Coquet Island, a small rocky spot, the seat of an old monastery,
facing it a little in the sea; and the small but romantic river
Coquet, running through it.&mdash;Sleep at Morpeth, a pleasant enough
little town, and on next day to Newcastle.&mdash;Meet with a very
agreeable, sensible fellow, a Mr. Chattox, who shows us a great many
civilities, and who dines and sups with us.</p>

<p><i>Wednesday.</i>&mdash;Left Newcastle early in the morning, and rode over a
fine country to Hexham to breakfast&mdash;from Hexham to Wardrue, the
celebrated Spa, where we slept.</p>

<p><i>Thursday</i>&mdash;Reach<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_527" id="Page_527">[527]</a></span> Longtown to dine, and part there with my good
friends Messrs. Hood and Ker&mdash;A hiring day in Longtown&mdash;I am
uncommonly happy to see so many young folks enjoying life.&mdash;I come to
Carlisle.&mdash;(Meet a strange enough romantic adventure by the way, in
falling in with a girl and her married sister&mdash;the girl, after some
overtures of gallantry on my side, sees me a little cut with the
bottle, and offers to take me in for a Gretna-Green affair.&mdash;I, not
being such a gull, as she imagines, make an appointment with her, by
way of <i>vive la bagatelle</i>, to hold a conference on it when we reach
town.&mdash;I meet her in town and give her a brush of caressing, and a
bottle of cider; but finding herself <i>un peu tromp&eacute;</i> in her man she
sheers off.) Next day I meet my good friend, Mr. Mitchell, and walk
with him round the town and its environs, and through his
printing-works, &amp;c.&mdash;four or five hundred people employed, many of
them women and children.&mdash;Dine with Mr. Mitchell, and leave
Carlisle.&mdash;Come by the coast to Annan.&mdash;Overtaken on the way by a
curious old fish of a shoemaker, and miner, from Cumberland mines.</p>

text of Scripture that contained a heavy denunciation against

&#8220;At a general encampment held this day, the following brethren were
made royal arch masons, viz. Robert Burns, from the Lodge of St.
James&#8217;s, Tarbolton, Ayrshire, and Robert Ainslie, from the Lodge of
St. Luke&#8217;s, Edinburgh by James Carmichael, Wm. Grieve, Daniel Dow,
John Clay, Robert Grieve, &amp;c. &amp;c. Robert Ainslie paid one guinea
admission dues; but on account of R. Burns&#8217;s remarkable poetical
genius, the encampment unanimously agreed to admit him gratis, and
considered themselves honoured by having a man of such shining
abilities for one of their companions.&#8221;

<h2><a name="THE_HIGHLAND_TOUR" id="THE_HIGHLAND_TOUR"></a>THE HIGHLAND TOUR.</h2>


<p class="sig">25<i>th August</i>, 1787.</p>

<p>I leave Edinburgh for a northern tour, in company with my good friend
Mr. Nicol, whose originality of humour promises me much
entertainment.&mdash;Linlithgow&mdash;a fertile improved country&mdash;West Lothian.
The more elegance and luxury among the farmers, I always observe in
equal proportion, the rudeness and stupidity of the peasantry. This
remark I have made all over the Lothians, Merse, Roxburgh, &amp;c. For
this, among other reasons, I think that a man of romantic taste, a
&#8220;Man of Feeling,&#8221; will be better pleased with the poverty, but
intelligent minds of the peasantry in Ayrshire (peasantry they are all
below the justice of peace) than the opulence of a club of Merse
farmers, when at the same time, he considers the vandalism of their
plough-folks, &amp;c. I carry this idea so far, that an unenclosed, half
improven country is to me actually more agreeable, and gives me more
pleasure as a prospect, than a country cultivated like a garden.&mdash;Soil
about Linlithgow light and thin.&mdash;The town carries the appearance of
rude, decayed grandeur&mdash;charmingly rural, retired situation. The old
royal palace a tolerably fine, but melancholy ruin&mdash;sweetly situated
on a small elevation, by the brink of a loch. Shown the room where the
beautiful, injured Mary Queen of Scots was born&mdash;a pretty good old
Gothic church. The infamous stool of repentance standing, in the old
Romish way, on a lofty situation.</p>

<p>What a poor pimping business is a Presbyterian place of worship;
dirty, narrow, and squalid; stuck in a corner of old popish grandeur
such as Linlithgow, and much more, Melrose! Ceremony and show, if
judiciously thrown in, absolutely necessary for the bulk of mankind,
both in religious and civil matters.&mdash;Dine.&mdash;Go to my friend
Smith&#8217;s at Avon printfield&mdash;find nobody but Mrs. Miller, an agreeable,
sensible, modest, good body; as useful, but not so ornamental as
Fielding&#8217;s Miss Western&mdash;not rigidly polite <i>&agrave; la Fran&ccedil;ais</i>, but easy,
hospitable, and housewifely.</p>

<p>An old lady from Paisley, a Mrs. Lawson, whom I promised to call for
in Paisley&mdash;like old lady W&mdash;&mdash;, and still more like Mrs. C&mdash;&mdash;, her
conversation is pregnant with strong sense and just remark, but like
them, a certain air of self-importance and a <i>duresse</i> in the eye,
seem to indicate, as the Ayrshire wife observed of her cow, that &#8220;she
had a mind o&#8217; her ain.&#8221;</p>

<p>Pleasant view of Dunfermline and the rest of the fertile coast of
Fife, as we go down to that dirty, ugly place, Borrowstones&mdash;see a
horse-race and call on a friend of Mr. Nicol&#8217;s, a Bailie Cowan, of
whom I know too little to attempt his portrait&mdash;Come through the rich
carse of Falkirk to pass the night. Falkirk nothing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_528" id="Page_528">[528]</a></span> remarkable except
the tomb of Sir John the Graham, over which, in the succession of
time, four stones have been placed.&mdash;Camelon, the ancient metropolis
of the Picts, now a small village in the neighbourhood of
Falkirk.&mdash;Cross the grand canal to Carron.&mdash;Come past Larbert and
admire a fine monument of cast-iron erected by Mr. Bruce, the African
traveller, to his wife.</p>

<p>Pass Dunipace, a place laid out with fine taste&mdash;a charming
amphitheatre bounded by Denny village, and pleasant seats down the way
to Dunnipace.&mdash;The Carron running down the bosom of the whole makes it
one of the most charming little prospects I have seen.</p>

<p>Dine at Auchinbowie&mdash;Mr. Monro an excellent, worthy old man&mdash;Miss
Monro an amiable, sensible, sweet young woman, much resembling Mrs.
Grierson. Come to Bannockburn&mdash;Shown the old house where James III.
finished so tragically his unfortunate life. The field of
Bannockburn&mdash;the hole where glorious Bruce set his standard. Here no
Scot can pass uninterested.&mdash;I fancy to myself that I see my gallant,
heroic countrymen coming o&#8217;er the hill and down upon the plunderers of
their country, the murderers of their fathers; noble revenge, and just
hate, glowing in every vein, striding more and more eagerly as they
approach the oppressive, insulting, blood-thirsty foe! I see them meet
in gloriously triumphant congratulation on the victorious field,
exulting in their heroic royal leader, and rescued liberty and
independence! Come to Stirling.&mdash;<i>Monday</i> go to Harvieston. Go to see
Caudron linn, and Rumbling brig, and Diel&#8217;s mill. Return in the
evening. Supper&mdash;Messrs. Doig, the schoolmaster; Bell; and Captain
Forrester of the castle&mdash;Doig a queerish figure, and something of a
pedant&mdash;Bell a joyous fellow, who sings a good song.&mdash;Forrester a
merry, swearing kind of man, with a dash of the sodger.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday Morning.</i>&mdash;Breakfast with Captain Forrester&mdash;Ochel
Hills&mdash;Devon River&mdash;Forth and Tieth&mdash;Allan River&mdash;Strathallan, a fine
country, but little improved&mdash;Cross Earn to Crieff&mdash;Dine and go to
Arbruchil&mdash;cold reception at Arbruchil&mdash;a most romantically pleasant
ride up Earn, by Auchtertyre and Comrie to Arbruchil&mdash;Sup at Crieff.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
